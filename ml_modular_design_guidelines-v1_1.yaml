  purpose: >
    To guide the design of short, online modules that support individual leaders
    and managers in developing specific competencies from their level's standards
    framework. Each module offers resources and provocations for learning rather
    than guaranteed competency achievement.
  theoryOfChange:
    - >-
      Initiating learning cycles that continue in workplace practice rather than
      completing development within the module.
    - >-
      Providing conceptual resources (P) alongside provocations for critical
      inquiry (Q) that challenge and transform thinking.
    - >-
      Catalysing reflection and experimentation that participants continue with
      peer support and in their specific contexts.
    - >-
      Guiding evidence gathering that connects modular engagement to formal
      competency assessment.
    - >-
      Creating entry points to deeper developmental work through programmes, peer
      communities, and sustained practice.
    - >-
      Modules cannot create competence, but they can resource the ongoing work of
      leadership development when participants actively engage as responsible
      agents of their own learning.
  keyTheoreticalModels:
    revansFormula:
      title: "Revans' Formula (L = P + Q)"
      L: Learning
      P: Programmed knowledge (Formal education, training, theory, best practice)
      Q: >-
        Questioning insight (Inquiry + Critical reflection leading to challenged
        and changed assumptions and an adapted understanding applied to new
        contexts)
    kolbsLearningCycle:
      title: "Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle"
      stages:
        - Concrete experience (Having an experience)
        - Reflective observation (Reflecting on the experience)
        - Abstract conceptualisation (Developing concept from the experience)
        - Active experimentation (Trying out new concept)
      note: >-
        Modules allow entry at any point and initiate cycles that participants
        complete in the workplace.
    integrativeDomains:
      title: "The 'I', 'We', 'It' Integrative Model"
      I: The internal (Personal mastery, self-awareness, resilience, values)
      We: >-
        The relational (Relational capability, team dynamics, collaboration,
        stakeholder engagement)
      It: >-
        The task (Operational effectiveness, technical competencies, strategic
        planning, outcomes)
  interventionContext:
    existingProcess: >
      Standards assessment leads to identified need. Assessment is through
      portfolio/evidence review, 360 feedback, and developmental conversation.
    audience: >-
      Leaders and managers aiming to re-evidence and attain a competency at Levels
      1, 2, 3, or 4.
  externalContext:
    - >-
      L&M Development Trends: Focus on adaptability, agility, human-centred
      leadership, continuous learning, and integrative approaches over generic,
      one-off workshops.
    - >-
      NHS 10-Year Plan: Shifting care to community settings, digital
      transformation, prevention over treatment, and workforce sustainability.
    - >-
      Global Leadership Context: Rise of polarising, crisis-driven styles,
      challenging traditional collaborative models.
  keyTensions:
    - Individual development (Leader) vs. collective accountability (leadership)
    - Standardisation vs. personalisation, autonomy, and collective accountability
    - Academic rigour vs. practical application
    - Leadership development vs. operational management capability
    - Peer assessment accountability vs. consistent competency evaluation
    - Reflexive practice depth vs. structured evidence requirements
    - Programme philosophy preservation vs. Shifting external policy
    - Support vs. challenge
  theoreticalFoundations:
    - 'Group dynamics & psychodynamics (Freud, Lewin, Jaques, et.al., 1900+)'
    - Humanistic psychology (Rogers, 1951)
    - Social construction (Berger et.al., 1966)
    - Systems theory (von Bertalanffy, 1968)
    - 'Critical theory (Particularly in education - Freire, 1970)'
    - 'Self-Managed Learning (Knowles, 1975)'
    - 'Complexity & emergence (Kauffman et.al., 1993)'
  corePrinciples:
    - id: principle_1
      title: Learning as participant responsibility
      statement: >-
        Learning cannot be deposited into people. Participants are responsible
        agents of their own learning journey. Modules provide theory,
        provocations, and structured opportunities for reflection, but cannot
        guarantee competency achievement. The module's task is to resource
        learning, not to create it.
      application: >-
        Module content explicitly frames the participant's active role. Opening
        activities establish that learning emerges through the participant's
        engagement with their own experience, not through passive consumption of
        content. Closing activities direct participants toward application and
        further inquiry rather than implying completion.
      rationale: >-
        Self-directed learning recognises that adults learn through making
        meaning of their experience. Modules that position participants as active
        meaning-makers develop the agency required for ongoing leadership
        development beyond the programme.
    - id: principle_2
      title: Entry into the learning cycle at multiple points
      statement: >-
        Following Kolb's experiential learning cycle, modules allow entry at
        concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualisation,
        or active experimentation. Modules initiate learning cycles that
        participants complete through sustained workplace practice over time, not
        within the two-hour engagement.
      application: >-
        Modules are structured to support different starting points: Concrete
        experience (Recent workplace situation), Reflective observation
        (Provocation to examine practice), Abstract conceptualisation
        (Theory/heuristic), Active experimentation (Behavioural experiment).
        Participants receive guidance on entering the cycle at their relevant
        point, with clear pathways to complete the cycle through workplace
        application.
      rationale: >-
        Leaders at different stages require different entry points. A two-hour
        module cannot complete transformational learning cycles, but it can
        catalyse learning that continues in practice. The initial entry point
        must engage participants and provide clear direction for ongoing work.
    - id: principle_3
      title: 'Integration of theory with transformational inquiry (P + Q = L)'
      statement: >-
        Following Revans' formula, learning (L) emerges from programmed knowledge
        (P) plus questioning insight (Q). Modules provide P (theory, frameworks,
        best practice) alongside rigorous Q (inquiry and critical reflection that
        challenges and changes assumptions, leading to adapted understanding
        applied to new contexts). Without Q, modules become mere information
        transfer.
      application: >-
        Every module includes: Programmed knowledge (P), Transformational inquiry
        (Q) (Structured processes that provoke genuine questioning, challenge
        assumptions, and develop new conceptual understanding), and Application
        tasks (Experiments to test transformed understanding). Q components
        require time and deep engagement.
      rationale: >-
        Leadership competence requires both knowledge and the capacity to
        question and transform that knowledge. The Q component is what makes
        learning transformational rather than informational. Without rigorous Q,
        modules simply add to what people know rather than changing how they
        think and act.

      title: "Competency development across domains ('I', 'We', 'It')"
      statement: >-
        Each competency operates across personal mastery ('I'), relational
        capability ('We'), and operational effectiveness ('It'). Modules
        introduce this integrative framework, recognising that leadership
        effectiveness emerges from the dynamic interaction of these three
        dimensions rather than from isolated skill development.
      application: >-
        Module content introduces the I-We-It framework where relevant: 'I'
        (Personal awareness, values), 'We' (Relational patterns, team dynamics),
        'It' (Task completion, outcomes). Modules provide provocations for
        participants to explore how the competency operates across these

        dimensions in their own context.
      rationale: >-
        Leadership competencies operate as integrated wholes. Modules introduce
        this integrative perspective, supporting participants to recognise
        interconnections and avoid fragmented development. Full integration
        occurs through sustained practice.
    - id: principle_5
      title: Peer learning communities for depth and integration
      statement: >-
        Individual modules have inherent limitations. Participants should
        establish or use existing peer learning groups (mentors, colleagues,
        action learning sets) to deepen reflection, test insights, and integrate
        learning across competencies.
      application: >-
        Each module includes: Explicit guidance on establishing a peer learning
        group, structured prompts for peer discussion, and specific questions to
        take to mentors or colleagues. Modules direct participants toward ongoing
        peer engagement.
      rationale: >-
        Leadership development is fundamentally relational. Individual online
        learning cannot replace the challenge, support, and perspective-taking
        that occurs through peer engagement. Modules must actively direct
        participants toward these richer learning contexts.
    - id: principle_6
      title: Reflective journaling as core leadership practice
      statement: >-
        Reflective journaling is a fundamental leadership tool for processing
        experience, tracking development, and making meaning from practice.
        Modules introduce and reinforce journaling as ongoing practice, not just
        for module completion but as sustained habit that supports leadership
        effectiveness.
      application: >-
        Modules provide: Introduction to journaling as leadership practice,
        structured prompts that can be used long-term, and guidance on using
        journals to track experiments, gather evidence, and process complex
        experiences.
      rationale: >-
        Reflective journaling develops the capacity for ongoing learning from
        experience. It provides a space for processing the emotional and
        cognitive complexity of leadership, tracking patterns, and constructing
        developmental narratives. It is essential infrastructure for leadership
        development.
    - id: principle_7
      title: Level-appropriate complexity and flexibility
      statement: >-
        Modules address the same competency framework across levels 1-4, but with
        differentiated complexity, language, and examples appropriate to each
        level. Design allows flexibility in learning approach within the
        constraints of individual online delivery.
      application: >-
        Module design varies by level in: Conceptual complexity, scope of
        organisational perspective (team vs. system), degree of ambiguity, and
        balance between concrete guidance and open exploration. All levels
        maintain the same core principles but apply them with level-appropriate
        sophistication.
      rationale: >-
        Level 1 managers and Level 4 executives require fundamentally different
        degrees of complexity, scope, and ambiguity tolerance. Differentiation
        across levels respects developmental readiness.
    - id: principle_8
      title: Contextualisation as essential
      statement: >-
        Learning emerges from and shapes specific organisational contexts. Modules
        cannot be context-free. Participants must actively translate content to
        their unique situation, examining how their learning connects to the
        systems they inhabit.
      application: >-
        Modules use: Multiple healthcare contexts in examples, explicit prompts to
        translate concepts to the participant's context, and questions about
        systemic patterns. Reflection activities require participants to name
        their specific context.
      rationale: >-
        Generic leadership content fails to develop the contextual judgment
        required for effective practice. Participants must actively engage in
        translating and adapting content to develop genuine capability rather
        than abstract knowledge.
    - id: principle_9
      title: Constitutional and ethical foundations
      statement: >-
        The NHS Constitution, Leadership Code, and Nolan Principles provide moral
        and practical foundation for all leadership development. Every module
        must connect competency development to these foundational commitments.
      application: >-
        Modules explicitly reference constitutional values when relevant.
        Reflection prompts ask how the competency supports constitutional
        commitments. Examples demonstrate ethical leadership in practice.
      rationale: >-
        NHS leadership derives legitimacy from public trust and constitutional
        mandate. Competency development divorced from these foundations risks
        technical capability without ethical grounding.
    - id: principle_10
      title: 'Difference, diversity, inclusion, and power as golden thread'
      statement: >-
        Power dynamics, structural inequalities, and the politics of difference
        affect all leadership competencies and all pedagogical relationships.
        Modules must explicitly address how identity, privilege, and systemic
        barriers shape both leadership practice and the learning process itself.
      application: >-
        Each module includes: Critical examination of how the competency
        intersects with power and inequality, recognition of diverse
        perspectives, reflection on whose knowledge is privileged, and questions
        that surface bias. This runs through all content, not as a separate
section.
      rationale: >-
        Healthcare serves diverse communities within systems shaped by structural
        inequalities. Leaders must understand how power and difference operate in
        their organisations and in their own learning. Critical pedagogy
        recognises that teaching is never neutral.
    - id: principle_11
      title: Evidence requirements, limitations, and pathways forward
      statement: >-
        Modules cannot test or confirm competency achievement. A two-hour module
        provides resources for learning, not proof of competence. Individual
        online modules also cannot achieve the depth, integration, or relational
        richness of comprehensive leadership development programmes. Modules
        explicitly acknowledge these limitations, guide evidence gathering for
        formal assessment, and direct participants toward opportunities for
        deeper development.
      application: >-
        Each module concludes with explicit guidance on: What evidence
        demonstrates this competency in practice, how to gather that evidence
        over time (weeks/months, not hours), how this relates to their assessment
        framework, what the module cannot achieve, and pathways to deeper
        learning. It clearly states completion does not equal competency.
      rationale: >-
        Competency frameworks require demonstration of capability in practice,
        not knowledge acquisition. Honest acknowledgment of limitations maintains
        programme integrity, sets appropriate expectations, and supports
        participants' long-term development journey.
