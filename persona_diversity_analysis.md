## 3. Logical consistency of diversity characteristics

### Assessment criteria

I examined each persona's diversity profile for:
- Internal consistency (characteristics align with each other)
- Consistency of gender terminology
- Realistic intersectionality
- Appropriate complexity for testing modules

### Gender consistency analysis

All personas use consistent terminology:
- **Woman/women**: Used throughout (not "female")
- **Man/men**: Used throughout (not "male")
- **Terminology**: Consistent British English approach

✓ **No gender terminology issues identified**

### Intersectionality authenticity

I reviewed whether the combination of characteristics in each persona represents realistic lived experience:

**Persona 1**: White British Jewish woman, working class, single parent, non-graduate, secular Jewish identity
- ✓ Consistent and realistic intersection. Secular/cultural Jewish identity with Holocaust survivor grandparents adds layer of intergenerational trauma and experiences of antisemitism despite not being religiously observant.

**Persona 2**: White Irish Traveller, disabled (dyslexia/ADHD), working class, first in family in formal employment
- ✓ Highly realistic. Irish Traveller community faces extreme discrimination, often combined with neurodivergence going undiagnosed. First formal employment is common pattern.

**Persona 3**: Mixed Black Caribbean/White British, care-experienced, young, new to healthcare
- ✓ Realistic intersection. Care-experienced young people from minoritised backgrounds face specific barriers to professional employment.

**Persona 4**: British Indian woman, disabled (chronic pain - hypermobility EDS), professional middle-class family, living with parents
- ✓ Highly realistic and sophisticated intersection. EDS often misdiagnosed as 'psychosomatic' in young women, especially women of colour. Model minority pressure from professional family creates tension with disability reality. Living with parents due to reduced hours reflects financial impact of disability on young professionals. Aspiring to OT qualification whilst managing chronic pain shows determination navigating ableist professional barriers.

**Persona 5**: White British, bisexual but not out at work
- ✓ Realistic. Many LGBTQ+ staff closeted in workplace despite being in Stage 1 roles.

**Persona 6**: Mixed Black Caribbean/White British, established professional
- ✓ Realistic mixed heritage professional trajectory.

**Persona 7**: British Pakistani, Muslim, wheelchair user (spinal cord injury), established pharmacist
- ✓ Complex but realistic. Triple minoritisation (ethnicity, religion, disability) in professional role. Spinal cord injury provides specific reasonable adjustment requirements.

**Persona 8**: Filipino, migrant nurse, Catholic, visa-dependent
- ✓ Highly realistic. Reflects international recruitment patterns, migrant nurse vulnerability, and Catholic Filipino demographic.

**Persona 9**: White British, gay and out, deaf/hard of hearing, mid-career
- ✓ Realistic and complex. Out gay man in male-dominated estates role with acquired hearing loss. Uses hearing aids and lip-reading, learning BSL. Intersectionality of gay identity and disability in technical/masculine culture adds important dimension. Acquired deafness represents significant disability category.

**Persona 10**: White British, age 63, approaching retirement within 2 years
- ✓ Realistic majority identity with significant age considerations. Now explicitly in 60+ age bracket, actively experiencing ageism and age-based assumptions about technical capability.

**Persona 11**: Black British (Ghanaian heritage), Christian, HR professional
- ✓ Realistic. Ghanaian British community well-represented in professional roles, Christian faith common.

**Persona 12**: White British, bisexual (not out), disabled child carer
- ✓ Realistic. Hidden sexual identity plus caring responsibilities common combination.

**Persona 13**: White British, disabled (acquired mobility impairment), caring responsibilities
- ✓ Realistic. Acquired disability plus caring shows multiple pressures on mid-career staff.

**Persona 14**: British Chinese woman, autistic, age 28, Senior House Officer in General Surgery
- ✓ Highly realistic and sophisticated intersection. Autistic woman diagnosed age 21 during medical school. British Chinese in male-dominated surgery facing model minority stereotypes and gendered expectations. Autism creates challenges with "unwritten rules," informal hierarchies, and sensory overwhelm in hospital environment. Direct communication style perceived as blunt. Clinical protocols feel safer than ambiguous social situations. Masking autistic traits professionally is exhausting. Intersectionality of East Asian woman + autism + surgery culture creates multiple layers of marginalisation.

**Persona 15**: White British trans man, age 35, gay, mental health lived experience
- ✓ Highly realistic and sophisticated intersection. Trans man who transitioned at age 21, out at work as both trans and gay, working in psychological wellbeing role. Mental health lived experience includes gender dysphoria journey. Working class background accessing profession through access course as mature student. "Passing privilege" as binary trans man means often assumed cisgender unless disclosed, creating complex navigation of when/how to disclose. Intersectionality of trans, gay, working class, mental health service user, and PWP (less powerful than clinical psychologist) creates multiple layers of marginalisation alongside white and male privilege (with caveats). Highly relevant for testing trans inclusion.

**Persona 16**: Mixed White British/British Pakistani, Muslim
- ✓ Realistic mixed heritage identity with maintained religious connection.

**Persona 17**: White British, heterosexual, senior professional
- ✓ Represents majority identity at senior level.

**Persona 18**: White British, lesbian and out, dyslexia/ADHD (diagnosed age 45), part-time worker
- ✓ Realistic and important. Out lesbian in senior role (Primary Care Practice Manager), part-time working for work-life balance. Late dyslexia/ADHD diagnosis at age 45 during leadership development programme demonstrates neurodivergence in established professionals. Represents how neurodivergent people compensate and mask for decades before diagnosis. Dense contracts and policies challenging due to dyslexia. ADHD hyperfocus strength for operational problem-solving.

**Persona 19**: British Chinese (Hong Kong heritage), specific cultural context
- ✓ Realistic. Hong Kong heritage carries specific migration history and potential political sensitivities.

**Persona 20**: Indian (Kerala heritage), Hindu, female professional
- ✓ Realistic. Kerala nursing/professional diaspora well-established, Hindu faith common.

**Persona 21**: Black British (Ghanaian heritage) woman, age 51, widowed single parent, heterosexual
- ✓ Highly significant and realistic intersection. Black African woman at executive level (Chief AHP) addresses critical underrepresentation in senior NHS leadership. Widowed single parent adds caring responsibilities intersecting with executive demands. Ghanaian heritage with working-class immigrant parents reflects first-generation professional trajectory. Chief AHP role requires navigating professional hierarchy (AHPs historically less powerful than medicine/nursing) alongside racism and gendered expectations. Represents authentic experience of "only Black woman in the room" at Board level, burden of representation, and strategic use of positional power to advocate for minoritised staff.

**Persona 22**: Black British (Ghanaian heritage), established consultant
- ✓ Realistic. Growing African heritage consultant cohort, though underrepresented.

**Persona 23**: Mixed Black Caribbean/White British, female executive
- ✓ Realistic but rare. Mixed heritage at executive level represents important intersectional leadership.

**Persona 24**: Black British (Nigerian heritage), Christian, CNO
- ✓ Highly significant. Nigerian heritage in CNO role represents important senior BAME representation.

**Persona 25**: White British, disabled (mental health - depression), recovered from alcohol dependency
- ✓ Complex and realistic. Mental health plus recovery in executive role shows lived experience at senior level, stigma navigation.

### Diversity consistency summary

- **Gender terminology**: ✓ Fully consistent
- **Intersectionality**: ✓ All personas show realistic, authentic combinations
- **Complexity appropriateness**: ✓ Good range from simple to complex identities
- **Testing potential**: ✓ Diversity profiles enable robust gap-analysis testing

**No logical inconsistencies identified in diversity characteristics.**

## 4. Persona diversity against WRES/WDES data

### Methodology

I compared persona characteristics against key workforce equality data from WRES 2024 and WDES 2024 reports to assess whether the persona set reflects authentic NHS workforce composition.

### Ethnicity analysis

#### NHS workforce ethnicity (WRES 2024 data)

- **BME staff overall**: 28.6% (434,077 people)
- **White staff**: 71.4%
- **Specific groups**:
  - London: 53.9% BME
  - South West: 17.3% BME (lowest)
  - Band 5 (nurses): 42.3% BME (highest representation)
  - Band 9: 12.0% BME (lowest representation)
  - Medical staff overall: 48.7% BME
  - Consultants: 41.0% BME
  - Board members (VSM): 16.5% BME

#### Persona ethnicity breakdown (n=25 completed personas)

| Ethnicity category | Count | Percentage | Notes |
|-------------------|-------|------------|-------|
| White British | 13 | 52.0% | Majority but appropriately lower than workforce 71.4% |
| Black British (Caribbean heritage) | 3 (mixed) | 12.0% | Mixed heritage representation |
| Black British (African - Ghanaian) | 3 | 12.0% | Specific African representation including executive |
| Black British (African - Nigerian) | 1 | 4.0% | Executive level representation |
| Asian British (Pakistani) | 2 | 8.0% | One mixed heritage |
| Asian British (Indian) | 2 | 8.0% | Kerala diaspora + British Indian professional |
| Asian British (Chinese) | 2 | 8.0% | Including Hong Kong heritage |
| Filipino | 1 | 4.0% | International recruitment |
| White Irish Traveller | 1 | 4.0% | Most discriminated minority |
| **Total BME** | **12** | **48.0%** | Higher than NHS average (28.6%) to ensure testing of minoritised experiences |

#### Analysis

**Overrepresentation of BME personas (48.0% vs 28.6% workforce)**:
- **Justified for testing purposes**: The persona set is designed for gap-analysis testing of whether modules address power, discrimination, and structural inequality. Higher BME representation ensures modules can be tested against diverse experiences of racism and marginalisation.
- **Above Band 5 demographics**: At 48.0%, above Band 5 (42.3% BME - WRES data), ensuring strong relevance to nursing and AHP roles where BME representation is highest.
- **Includes specific high-discrimination groups**:
  - Irish Traveller (Persona 2): WRES reports Irish Traveller staff experience highest harassment from public (41.2% men, 37.7% women)
  - Filipino nurse (Persona 8): Reflects international recruitment patterns and specific vulnerabilities
  - Multiple Black African/Caribbean personas: Addresses specific experiences of anti-Black racism, including at executive level
  - British Indian with chronic pain (Persona 4): Reflects model minority pressure and diagnostic inequalities
  - Ghanaian Chief AHP (Persona 21): Tests senior leadership experiences of racism, professional hierarchy navigation

**Heritage diversity**:
- ✓ Ghanaian, Nigerian, Caribbean, Pakistani, Indian (Kerala), Chinese, Hong Kong, Filipino all represented
- ✓ Avoids homogenising "BME" or "Asian" - specific cultural contexts included
- ✓ Mixed heritage personas (3) reflect growing mixed-race population

**Gaps**:
- No Bangladeshi representation
- No Eastern European representation
- No Middle Eastern/Arab representation (though discrimination is referenced in WRES for Arab staff)

**Verdict**: Ethnicity representation is **intentionally overweighted** for testing purposes and **appropriately diverse** in heritage specificity. Justified by testing requirements.

### Disability analysis

#### NHS workforce disability (WDES 2024 data)

- **Declared disability (ESR)**: 5.7% (86,312 people)
- **Unknown status**: 14.3%
- **NHS Staff Survey disability**: 25.05% (more representative)
- **UK working-age population**: 24% disabled
- **Specific issues**:
  - Disabled staff 2.04x more likely to enter capability proceedings
  - 30.0% disabled staff experienced harassment from public (vs 23.3% non-disabled)
  - 14.6% experienced harassment from managers (vs 8.2% non-disabled)
  - Only 74.5% reported reasonable adjustments made

#### Persona disability breakdown (n=25 completed personas)

| Disability type | Count | Percentage | Visibility | Notes |
|-----------------|-------|------------|------------|-------|
| Neurodivergent (dyslexia/ADHD) | 1 | 4.0% | Initially invisible, diagnosed adult | Persona 2 |
| Physical (wheelchair user - SCI) | 1 | 4.0% | Visible | Persona 7 |
| Chronic pain/fatigue (EDS) | 1 | 4.0% | Fluctuating visibility (mobility aids) | Persona 4 |
| Deaf/hard of hearing (acquired) | 1 | 4.0% | Visible (hearing aids), learning BSL | Persona 9 |
| Disabled child (carer) | 1 | 4.0% | Hidden disability by association | Persona 11 |
| Acquired mobility impairment | 1 | 4.0% | Visible | Persona 13 |
| Mental health (depression, managed) | 1 | 4.0% | Invisible unless disclosed | Persona 25 |
| Mental health lived experience (+ gender dysphoria) | 1 | 4.0% | Historical, relevant to role, trans | Persona 15 |
| **Total with disability** | **8** | **32.0%** | Mix of visible/invisible | Above NHS Staff Survey (25%) |
| **None disclosed** | **17** | **68.0%** | | |

#### Analysis

**32% disability representation**:
- ✓ **Above NHS Staff Survey data (25.05%)** - intentionally overweighted for testing purposes
- ✓ **Above UK working-age population (24%)**
- ✓ Much higher than ESR declarations (5.7%), reflecting realistic under-disclosure in formal HR systems
- Addition of chronic pain/fatigue condition (EDS) and deaf/hard of hearing (Persona 9) reflects significant underrepresented disability types

**Disability type diversity**:
- ✓ Physical disabilities: 2 (wheelchair user, acquired mobility impairment)
- ✓ Sensory disabilities: 1 (deaf/hard of hearing with hearing aids, learning BSL)
- ✓ Chronic pain/fatigue: 1 (EDS - hypermobility syndrome, often misdiagnosed)
- ✓ Neurodivergence: 3 personas
  - Dyslexia/ADHD: 2 (Persona 2 diagnosed in 20s, Persona 18 diagnosed at age 45)
  - Autism: 1 (Persona 14 - British Chinese woman, diagnosed age 21 during medical school)
- ✓ Mental health: 2 (depression/alcohol recovery, lived experience in MH role including trans-related)
- ✓ Carer of disabled child: 1 (child with autism and learning disabilities - Persona 11)

**Visibility spectrum**:
- ✓ Visible disabilities: 4 (wheelchair user, acquired mobility impairment, hearing aids, fluctuating EDS)
- ✓ Invisible disabilities: 4 (neurodivergent, mental health conditions, carer, gender dysphoria history)
- Reflects reality that most disabilities have both visible and invisible aspects

**Intersectionality**:
- Irish Traveller + neurodivergent/ADHD + working class (Persona 2): Reflects diagnostic inequality in marginalized communities
- British Indian + chronic pain EDS (Persona 4): Model minority pressure with invisible disability, diagnostic delays common for women of colour
- Pakistani Muslim + wheelchair user (Persona 7): Triple minoritisation
- Gay + deaf/hard of hearing (Persona 9): Intersectionality in male-dominated technical field
- British Chinese woman + autistic + surgery (Persona 14): Model minority stereotypes, gendered surgery culture, navigating unwritten rules as autistic person
- Trans + mental health lived experience (Persona 15): Gender dysphoria journey, trans healthcare navigation
- Dyslexia/ADHD diagnosed at 45 + lesbian (Persona 18): Late diagnosis during leadership development
- White British + mental health + recovery (Persona 25): Executive-level disclosure

**Gaps addressed**:
- ✓ Sensory disability now represented (deaf/hard of hearing with BSL)
- ✓ Trans-related healthcare and mental health represented

**Terminology clarification**:
In UK terminology (NHS context):
- **Learning disability** = intellectual/developmental disability (e.g., Down syndrome, severe autism with intellectual impairment)
- **Learning difficulties/differences** = dyslexia, ADHD, autism (without intellectual impairment)

**Remaining gaps**:
- No persona with learning disability themselves (though Persona 12 is carer for child with autism AND learning disabilities - carer perspective represented)
- Note: Personas DO have learning difficulties (dyslexia, ADHD, autism) - 3 personas with neurodivergence
- No visual impairment or blindness
- No diabetes, epilepsy, or other episodic conditions (though EDS partially addresses fluctuating conditions)
- No Deaf culture/BSL-first perspective (Persona 9 is audiologically deaf but not culturally Deaf)

**Verdict**: Disability representation is **intentionally overweighted** at 32% (vs 24-25% NHS/UK data) for robust testing purposes. Shows **excellent diversity** of disability types including underrepresented chronic pain/fatigue, sensory disabilities, and neurodivergence (autism, ADHD, dyslexia). Addresses critical gap in deaf/hard of hearing representation. Autism represented through British Chinese woman surgeon navigating "unwritten rules" and sensory overwhelm. Strong for testing reasonable adjustments, BSL access, communication accommodations, energy management, neurodivergent workplace needs, and invisible disability discrimination.

### Sexual orientation analysis

#### NHS workforce sexual orientation (no comprehensive WRES/WDES data)

- **General UK population**: ~3-5% LGB+ (ONS data)
- **NHS data**: Limited workforce-wide SO data
- **Context**: LGBT+ people more likely in healthcare/helping professions than general population

#### Persona sexual orientation breakdown (n=25)

| Orientation | Count | Percentage | Out at work? | Career stage |
|------------|-------|------------|--------------|--------------|
| Heterosexual (stated) | 9 | 36.0% | N/A | Various |
| Heterosexual (implied) | 10 | 40.0% | N/A | Various |
| Bisexual (not out) | 2 | 8.0% | No | Stage 1, Stage 2 |
| Gay (out) | 3 | 12.0% | Yes | Stage 1, Stage 3, Stage 4 |
| Lesbian (out) | 1 | 4.0% | Yes | Stage 3 |
| **Total LGB+** | **6** | **24.0%** | Mixed | All stages |

#### Analysis

**24% LGB+ representation**:
- ⚠️ **Significantly higher than UK population (3-5%)** and likely NHS workforce
- **Justified for testing**: Sexual orientation affects workplace experience (coming out, discrimination, heteronormative assumptions)
- Reflects that LGBT+ people disproportionately work in healthcare/public sector

**Closeted vs out**:
- ✓ **2 bisexual personas not out at work** (Persona 5 Stage 1, Persona 11 Stage 2)
- ✓ **4 personas out at work** (3 gay men, 1 lesbian)
- Reflects realistic pattern: coming out increases with seniority/security, bisexual people face specific bi erasure

**Career stage representation**:
- Stage 1: 1 bisexual (closeted)
- Stage 2: 1 bisexual (closeted)
- Stage 3: 1 gay (out), 1 lesbian (out)
- Stage 4: 1 gay (out)
- ✓ Shows progression from closeted to out as careers advance

**Gaps**:
- No trans or non-binary representation (significant gap)
- No asexual/aromantic representation
- No queer or other identities

**Verdict**: LGB representation **overweighted for testing** (24% vs ~5% population) but **justified** for examining heteronormative assumptions and discrimination. **Critical gap**: No trans/non-binary personas means modules cannot be tested for trans inclusion.

### Religion and belief analysis

#### NHS workforce religion data (limited in WRES/WDES)

- No comprehensive workforce data on religion
- WRES notes: Arab, Pakistani, Bangladeshi staff face specific Islamophobia
- Christian, Muslim, Hindu, and Sikh staff represented across NHS

#### Persona religion breakdown (n=25)

| Religion | Count | Percentage | Notes |
|----------|-------|------------|-------|
| Not stated | 16 | 64.0% | Most personas don't specify |
| Muslim | 3 | 12.0% | Pakistani (2), mixed heritage (1) |
| Christian | 3 | 12.0% | Ghanaian (1), Nigerian (1), Filipino (1) |
| Jewish | 1 | 4.0% | Secular/cultural Jewish, Holocaust survivor grandparents |
| Hindu | 1 | 4.0% | Kerala Indian heritage |
| Catholic | 1 | 4.0% | Filipino (overlap with Christian) |

#### Analysis

**Religion specification**:
- 9 personas (36%) specify religion
- ✓ Reflects that religion often unstated unless relevant to discrimination experience
- ✓ All specified religions connect to ethnicity/cultural heritage (realistic)

**Muslim representation**:
- 3 personas, all connected to Pakistani or mixed Pakistani heritage
- ✓ Realistic as Islam is defining identity feature for many Pakistani British people
- ✓ One is wheelchair user, showing intersectional Muslim identity

**Christian representation**:
- 3 personas from Ghanaian, Nigerian, Filipino backgrounds
- ✓ Realistic as Christianity central to these diaspora communities
- Catholic specified for Filipino (accurate cultural detail)

**Jewish representation**:
- 1 persona, secular/cultural Jewish identity
- ✓ Important addition addressing antisemitism
- ✓ Nuanced representation: not religiously observant but culturally Jewish
- ✓ Holocaust survivor grandparents adds intergenerational trauma dimension
- ✓ Addresses rising antisemitism in UK context
- ✓ Complex relationship to Israel/Palestine conflict
- ✓ Intersects with working class, single parent identities

**Hindu representation**:
- 1 persona, Kerala heritage
- ✓ Accurate (Kerala has significant Hindu population)

**Gaps addressed**:
- ✓ Jewish representation now included (Persona 1)

**Remaining gaps**:
- No Sikh representation
- No Buddhist representation
- No explicitly atheist/humanist representation
- Limited explicit representation of religious discrimination experiences in evaluation scenarios (though antisemitism and Islamophobia referenced in positionality)

**Verdict**: Religion representation **realistic and proportionate** where specified. Appropriate that most personas don't specify religion. Addition of Jewish identity (Persona 1) addresses important gap in testing antisemitism and religious/cultural discrimination. Good diversity for testing religious inclusion and combating religious discrimination.

### Age analysis

#### NHS workforce age data (from WRES/WDES context)

- NHS workforce spans 18-70+
- Peak recruitment: 20-35
- Mid-career: 35-50
- Senior leaders: 45-65
- Retention challenges across all ages

#### Persona age breakdown (n=25)

| Age band | Count | Percentage | Roles |
|----------|-------|------------|-------|
| 20-29 | 5 | 20.0% | Fundamental & Stage 1 early careers |
| 30-39 | 9 | 36.0% | Stage 1 & Stage 2 established professionals |
| 40-49 | 7 | 28.0% | Stage 2 & Stage 3 senior professionals |
| 50-59 | 3 | 12.0% | Stage 2 & Stage 3 near-retirement |
| 60+ | 1 | 4.0% | Stage 2, actively experiencing ageism |

#### Analysis

**Age distribution**:
- ✓ **Appropriate concentration in 30-49 range (64%)**: Reflects NHS workforce demographics
- ✓ **Younger staff in Fundamental/Stage 1**: Realistic career entry
- ✓ **Older staff in Stage 2-4**: Realistic seniority progression
- ✓ **Staff over 60 now represented**: Persona 10 (age 63)

**Career stage alignment**:
- Fundamental (20s): ✓ Appropriate
- Stage 1 (late 20s-late 30s): ✓ Appropriate
- Stage 2 (30s-60s): ✓ Appropriate - includes Persona 10 (63)
- Stage 3 (40s-50s): ✓ Appropriate
- Stage 4 (40s-50s): ✓ Appropriate (though some executives older)

**Age discrimination testing**:
- Persona 10 (63): Explicitly experiencing ageism, within 2 years of retirement, age-based assumptions about technical capability
- Persona 9 (42): Mid-career with acquired disability (deafness)
- Persona 17 (47): Assistant Director, mid-senior
- ✓ Strong representation of older workers' experience, particularly ageism

**Gaps addressed**:
- ✓ Staff over 60 now represented (Persona 10, age 63)
- ✓ Explicit ageism experiences in diversity profile

**Remaining gaps**:
- Only one person 60+ (though this is proportionate to workforce)
- No young people in very senior roles (possible but rare)

**Verdict**: Age distribution **realistic** and **well-aligned with career stages**. Addition of Persona 10 at age 63 addresses critical gap in 60+ representation and enables testing of ageism and age discrimination.

### Social class and educational background

#### NHS workforce class data (not in WRES/WDES, but contextually significant)

- NHS increasingly graduate-dominated in professional roles
- Class barriers to progression documented
- Non-clinical staff often working class backgrounds
- Clinical staff mixed but skewing middle class in senior roles

#### Persona class/education breakdown (n=24)

| Class/education | Count | Percentage | Roles |
|-----------------|-------|------------|-------|
| Working class, non-graduate | 5 | 20.8% | Medical sec, ECA, HCA, estates, engineer |
| Working class, graduate route | 2 | 8.3% | Migrant professionals |
| Middle class, graduate | 15 | 62.5% | Most clinical & professional roles |
| Not specified | 2 | 8.3% | |

**Educational routes**:
- A-levels only: 1
- NVQ/apprenticeship: 2
- Nursing diploma: 1
- Degree (UK): ~15
- Degree (international): 2
- Postgraduate: ~8

#### Analysis

**Class representation**:
- ✓ **20.8% working class**: Reflects significant minority who face class barriers
- ✓ **Working class concentrated in non-clinical and emergency roles**: Realistic
- ✓ **Middle class dominance (62.5%)**: Reflects graduate professions
- ✓ **Class mobility through education**: Some personas show working class → professional transition

**Educational pathways**:
- ✓ **Apprenticeship route**: 2 personas (ECA, engineer)
- ✓ **Non-graduate professional**: 1 persona (medical secretary - very realistic)
- ✓ **International qualifications**: 2 personas (reflects international recruitment)
- ⚠️ **Limited representation of vocational routes** into clinical roles

**Class discrimination testing**:
- Persona 1: Working class, non-graduate, accent discrimination
- Persona 2: Irish Traveller working class (extreme marginalisation)
- Persona 3: Care-experienced (class-related)
- ✓ **Good representation of class-based barriers**

**Verdict**: Class representation **good for testing** but **underrepresents** the working-class composition of NHS (particularly support staff, healthcare assistants). Provides sufficient diversity to test class assumptions in modules.

### Geographic and migration status

#### NHS workforce migration data (from WRES/WDES context)

- Significant international recruitment (nurses, doctors)
- Visa-dependent staff vulnerable
- Regional variations in workforce composition

#### Persona migration/location breakdown (n=24)

| Status | Count | Percentage | Details |
|--------|-------|------------|---------|
| UK-born, settled | 20 | 83.3% | Majority |
| International migrant | 2 | 8.3% | Filipino nurse (visa), Hong Kong Chinese (settled) |
| UK-born diaspora | 2 | 8.3% | Heritage specified but UK-born |
| Semi-nomadic | 1 | 4.2% | Irish Traveller |

**Regional specification**:
- West Midlands: 1
- Urban ambulance service: 1
- Community/ICB: 4
- Not specified: 18

#### Analysis

**Migration representation**:
- ✓ **Filipino migrant nurse**: Highly realistic international recruitment pattern
- ✓ **Visa dependency vulnerability**: Explicitly addressed
- ✓ **Hong Kong heritage**: Specific migration wave represented
- ⚠️ **Limited other migration patterns**: No Eastern European, African, Middle Eastern migrants

**Geographic diversity**:
- ⚠️ **Limited regional specification**: Most personas could be anywhere
- ✓ **Mix of rural/urban**: Some community roles, some ICB/acute
- ⚠️ **London underrepresented**: Given 53.9% BME workforce in London

**Verdict**: Migration status **underrepresented** (8.3% international vs reality of international recruitment). Geographic diversity **limited** but not critical for module testing.

## 5. Overall diversity representation summary

### Quantitative summary table

| Characteristic | Persona % | NHS/UK % | Assessment | Justification |
|---------------|-----------|----------|------------|---------------|
| **BME ethnicity** | 48.0% | 28.6% (NHS) | Intentional overweight | Testing requires diverse experiences of racism |
| **Disability** | 32.0% | 25.0% (NHS survey) | Intentional overweight | Includes sensory, chronic pain, neurodivergent, mental health |
| **LGB+** | 24.0% | 3-5% (UK) | Intentional overweight | Testing heteronormative assumptions |
| **Trans/non-binary** | 4.0% | ~0.5-1% (UK) | ✓ Above population | **Gap addressed** - Persona 15 is trans man |
| **Jewish** | 4.0% | ~0.5% (UK) | Above population | Addresses antisemitism testing |
| **Deaf/hard of hearing** | 4.0% | ~11% (UK) | Below population | **Gap addressed** - Persona 9 uses BSL |
| **Women** | 52.0% | ~77% (NHS) | Underrepresented | But reflects leadership pipeline reality |
| **Men** | 44.0% | ~23% (NHS) | Overrepresented | Reflects senior roles skew |
| **Working class** | 20.0% | ? (no NHS data) | Good for testing | Sufficient to examine class barriers |
| **Muslim** | 12.0% | ~6% (UK) | Slight overweight | Testing Islamophobia important |
| **Age 50+** | 16.0% | ~25% (NHS) | Underrepresented | But now includes 60+ |
| **Age 60+** | 4.0% | ~10% (NHS est.) | Below but represented | **Gap addressed** - Persona 10 age 63 |

### Qualitative assessment

#### Strengths

1. **Intersectionality complexity**: Multiple personas have 3+ intersecting minoritised identities (e.g. Pakistani Muslim wheelchair user; Irish Traveller neurodivergent working class; British Indian with chronic pain from professional family)

2. **Authentic combinations**: No "diversity bingo" - all intersections reflect real lived experience patterns

3. **Hidden and visible identities**: Good mix of visible (wheelchair, ethnicity) and invisible (bisexual closeted, neurodivergence, mental health, chronic pain)

4. **Fluctuating disabilities**: EDS persona represents important category of fluctuating/episodic disabilities often dismissed or misunderstood

5. **Trans representation**: Persona 15 is trans man, transitioned at 21, out at work, with nuanced exploration of "passing privilege," disclosure navigation, and intersection with gay identity and mental health lived experience

6. **Sensory disability**: Persona 9 deaf/hard of hearing with hearing aids, learning BSL, acquired deafness in male-dominated technical field

7. **Jewish representation**: Persona 1 secular/cultural Jewish with Holocaust survivor grandparents, addresses antisemitism and intergenerational trauma

8. **Power and privilege distribution**: Personas range from precarious (migrant visa-dependent) to privileged (white heterosexual executive) with many complex positions in between

9. **Specific cultural contexts**: Not generic "BME" - Ghanaian, Nigerian, Filipino, Pakistani, Indian (Kerala), Hong Kong Chinese all specified

10. **Disability diversity**: Physical, sensory (deaf), neurodivergent (autism, ADHD, dyslexia), mental health, chronic pain, acquired, childhood - excellent range

11. **Neurodivergent diversity**: Autism (Persona 14 - diagnosed age 21), ADHD/dyslexia at different life stages (Persona 2 - diagnosed in 20s, Persona 18 - diagnosed at 45), demonstrating both early and late diagnosis experiences

12. **Career stage representation**: Minoritised identities distributed across all stages (not just junior roles)

13. **Age diversity**: Now includes 60+ representation (Persona 10, age 63) with explicit ageism experiences

#### Gaps addressed in v0.2.4

1. ✓ **Trans representation**: Persona 15 is now trans man (previously identified as critical gap)

2. ✓ **Sensory disabilities**: Persona 9 is deaf/hard of hearing (previously identified as high priority gap)

3. ✓ **Age 60+**: Persona 10 is now 63 (previously identified as high priority gap)

4. ✓ **Jewish representation**: Persona 1 now has secular/cultural Jewish identity (previously identified as gap in religion/belief)

#### Remaining critical gaps

1. **Non-binary representation**: Trans man represented, but no non-binary or trans woman personas. Limits testing of non-binary inclusion and trans feminine experiences.

2. **Learning disabilities**: No representation of learning disabilities.

3. **Visual impairment**: No blind or visually impaired personas (deaf/hard of hearing now represented).

4. **Bangladeshi ethnicity**: Significant UK population, not represented.

5. **Eastern European**: Major NHS workforce component, not represented.

6. **Sikh faith**: Significant NHS workforce group, not represented.

7. **Regional specification**: Most personas could be anywhere - limits testing of regional contexts (e.g. London diversity vs rural homogeneity).

#### Testing adequacy

**Can effectively test**:
- ✓ Anti-Black racism
- ✓ Anti-Asian racism and Islamophobia
- ✓ Antisemitism (secular/cultural Jewish identity)
- ✓ Irish Traveller discrimination (most marginalised)
- ✓ Disability discrimination and reasonable adjustments
- ✓ Deaf/hard of hearing access (BSL, hearing aids, audism)
- ✓ Autism in workplace (navigating unwritten rules, sensory overwhelm, masking, direct communication style)
- ✓ Neurodivergence: ADHD and dyslexia (including late diagnosis)
- ✓ Trans inclusion and transphobia (trans man representation)
- ✓ Heteronormative assumptions and LGB discrimination
- ✓ Class and educational barriers
- ✓ Chronic pain and fluctuating disabilities
- ✓ Mental health stigma
- ✓ Ageism and age discrimination (including 60+)
- ✓ Migrant vulnerability
- ✓ Intersectional oppression (e.g., model minority + autism + gendered surgery culture)
- ✓ Carer responsibilities (including caring for disabled children)

**Cannot test**:
- ✗ Non-binary inclusion
- ✗ Trans feminine experiences (trans woman)
- ✗ Culturally Deaf perspectives (Persona 9 is audiologically deaf but not Deaf)
- ✗ Visual impairment or blindness
- ✗ Learning disability inclusion (UK term: intellectual/developmental disability) - only carer perspective represented
- ✗ Specific Eastern European discrimination
- ✗ Sikh inclusion and discrimination

**Important note**: Learning *difficulties* (dyslexia, ADHD, autism) ARE well represented. The gap is specifically learning *disability* (UK term for intellectual/developmental disability).

**Partially can test**:
- ⚠️ Regional variations (limited geographic specification)
- ⚠️ BSL access (Persona 9 learning BSL but not primary language)

---

## 6. Recommendations

### ✓ Addressed in v0.2.4 (previously Critical/High Priority)

1. ✓ **Trans persona added**: Persona 15 is now trans man, age 35, gay, working in mental health (previously Critical gap)

2. ✓ **Deaf/hard of hearing persona added**: Persona 9 is deaf/hard of hearing, uses hearing aids, learning BSL (previously High Priority gap)

3. ✓ **Age 60+ persona added**: Persona 10 is now 63, explicitly experiencing ageism (previously High Priority gap)

4. ✓ **Jewish representation added**: Persona 1 now has secular/cultural Jewish identity with Holocaust survivor grandparents (addresses antisemitism testing)

### Critical (must address)

1. **Update YAML version number**: File shows version "0.2.3" but should be "0.2.4" to match filename

2. **Verify YAML syntax**: Check for any parsing errors (line 1016 quotation marks issue may still exist from v0.2.3)

### High priority (strongly recommended)

3. **Add non-binary persona**: Trans man now represented, but non-binary representation still missing. Add persona with non-binary identity to test non-binary inclusion and they/them pronoun usage.

4. **Add trans woman**: Trans masculine experience represented (Persona 15), but trans feminine experience missing. Trans women face specific discrimination patterns.

5. **Specify religious discrimination experiences**: For Muslim, Jewish, and other religious personas, add explicit experiences of Islamophobia, antisemitism to evaluation questions (currently only in positionality, not evaluation scenarios)

6. **Add Eastern European persona**: Represents significant NHS workforce, faces specific discrimination (e.g., Polish, Romanian)

### Medium priority (beneficial)

7. **Add persona with learning disability**: A persona who themselves has a learning disability (intellectual/developmental disability - UK term). Currently only carer perspective represented (Persona 12's child). Note: Learning difficulties (dyslexia, ADHD, autism) are well represented - this gap refers specifically to intellectual/developmental disabilities.

8. **Add Bangladeshi heritage**: Specific community experiences, distinct from Pakistani

9. **Add Sikh persona**: Represents significant NHS workforce

10. **Add visual impairment/blindness**: Sensory disability now represented (deaf/hard of hearing), but visual impairment missing

11. **Specify geographic context**: For some personas, add specific regional contexts to test rural vs urban, London vs regions

12. **Add culturally Deaf persona**: Persona 9 is audiologically deaf but not culturally Deaf. BSL-first/Deaf culture perspective missing.

### Low priority (nice to have)

13. **Add care leaver in senior role**: Currently only in Fundamental stage (Persona 3)

14. **Age diversity under 25**: Very junior staff member

15. **Add diabetes, epilepsy or other episodic conditions**: Though EDS now provides some representation of fluctuating disability

16. **Add trans woman in senior leadership**: Persona 15 is Stage 2; trans representation at executive level would test additional dynamics

17. **Expand neurodivergent representation**: Autism now represented (Persona 14), but could add more neurodivergent conditions (e.g., dyspraxia, dyscalculia) or different autism presentations

---

## 7. Conclusion

### Question 1: Do personas match Draft 2.2.docx?

**Answer**: **100% match (25/25)**
- All 25 personas present
- All roles correctly aligned with Draft 2.2
- Persona 21 now corrected to Chief Allied Health Professional

### Question 2: Do learning needs relate appropriately to roles?

**Answer**: **Yes, 100% appropriate (25/25)**
- All 25 personas have highly realistic, role-appropriate learning needs
- Learning needs consistently reflect:
  - Appropriate career stage concerns
  - Realistic workplace challenges
  - Relevant framework competencies
  - Authentic development trajectories
- Persona 4 (Community Therapy Support Worker with EDS) shows excellent alignment: career development while managing chronic pain, reasonable adjustments navigation, and balancing study with fluctuating health
- Persona 21 (Chief AHP) shows appropriate strategic focus: AHP workforce leadership, professional standards, navigating racism at executive level, building AHP voice in medicine/nursing-dominated hierarchy

### Question 3: Do diversity characteristics make logical sense?

**Answer**: **Yes, fully consistent**
- ✓ Gender terminology consistent throughout (woman/man)
- ✓ All intersectional combinations authentic and realistic
- ✓ Good mix of visible and invisible identities
- ✓ Characteristics appropriately distributed across career stages
- ✓ No logical inconsistencies identified

### Overall verdict

The persona set is **high quality** with **excellent intersectional sophistication** and **authentic lived experience representation**. The diversity profiles enable robust testing of power dynamics, structural inequality, and transformational learning.

**Major improvements in v0.2.4**:
1. ✓ **Trans representation added**: Persona 15 is now trans man (transitioned age 21, out at work, gay, mental health lived experience) - **addresses previously critical gap**
2. ✓ **Deaf/hard of hearing representation added**: Persona 9 now deaf/hard of hearing (hearing aids, learning BSL, acquired deafness) - **addresses previously high priority gap**
3. ✓ **Age 60+ representation added**: Persona 10 now 63 (explicitly experiencing ageism, within 2 years of retirement) - **addresses previously high priority gap**
4. ✓ **Jewish representation added**: Persona 1 now secular/cultural Jewish (Holocaust survivor grandparents, experiences antisemitism) - **addresses antisemitism testing gap**

**Continued strengths from earlier versions**:
- **Persona 4**: Crucial chronic pain/fatigue representation (EDS), British Indian perspective with model minority pressure, demonstrates intersection of disability, ethnicity, and professional family expectations
- **Persona 21**: Chief AHP role with Black Ghanaian woman executive, addresses professional hierarchy (AHP vs medicine/nursing), senior leadership experiences of racism, widowed single parent navigating executive demands
- **Complete set**: All 25 personas present and correctly aligned with Draft 2.2

**Outstanding critical issues**:
1. YAML version number mismatch (file shows "0.2.3", filename is v0_2_4)
2. Verify YAML syntax (check line 1016 quotation marks issue from v0.2.3)

**Remaining high priority gaps**:
- Non-binary representation (trans man added, but non-binary missing)
- Trans woman representation (trans masculine experience represented, trans feminine missing)
- Eastern European representation (significant NHS workforce)

The persona set now enables comprehensive testing of:
- ✓ Trans inclusion and transphobia (trans man)
- ✓ Deaf/hard of hearing access and audism
- ✓ Ageism and age discrimination (including 60+)
- ✓ Antisemitism
- ✓ Plus all previously testable areas (anti-Black racism, Islamophobia, disability discrimination, LGB discrimination, class barriers, etc.)

The diversity representation is **intentionally overweighted** in BME (48%), disability (32%), LGB (24%), and trans (4%) identities to ensure modules can be rigorously tested for inclusivity, not to match workforce composition exactly. This is **appropriate and justified** for testing purposes.
