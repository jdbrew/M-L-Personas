## Summary Statistics

### Gender Distribution
- **Women:** 13 (52%)
- **Men:** 11 (44%)
- **Non-binary:** 0 (0%)
- **Trans representation:** 1 trans man (4%)

**Analysis:** Gender distribution broadly reflects NHS leadership pipeline rather than overall NHS workforce (77% women). The absence of non-binary representation represents a critical gap for testing non-binary inclusion.

---

### Ethnicity Breakdown
- **White British:** 13 (52%)
- **Black African heritage:** 3 (12%) - Ghanaian (2), Nigerian (1)
- **Mixed heritage:** 3 (12%) - Black Caribbean/White British
- **British Pakistani:** 2 (8%)
- **British Chinese:** 2 (8%)
- **British Indian:** 1 (4%)
- **Filipino:** 1 (4%)
- **White Irish Traveller:** 1 (4%)

**Total BME representation:** 12 personas (48%)

**Analysis:** BME representation (48%) is intentionally higher than NHS workforce average (28.6%) to enable rigorous testing of experiences of racism, discrimination, and structural inequality. Specific heritage contexts (Ghanaian, Nigerian, Filipino, Pakistani, Indian, Chinese, Irish Traveller) allow testing of distinct cultural experiences rather than homogenised "BME" approaches.

**Remaining gaps:** No Bangladeshi, Eastern European, or Sikh representation.

---

### Disability Representation
- **Physical disabilities:** 2 (8%) - wheelchair user, acquired mobility impairment
- **Sensory disabilities:** 1 (4%) - deaf/hard of hearing (acquired, uses hearing aids, learning BSL)
- **Chronic pain/fatigue:** 1 (4%) - Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome
- **Neurodivergent:** 3 (12%)
  - Dyslexia/ADHD diagnosed in 20s: 1
  - Dyslexia/ADHD diagnosed at age 45: 1
  - Autism diagnosed age 21: 1
- **Mental health lived experience:** 2 (8%) - including trans-related experiences, depression/recovery
- **Carers of disabled children:** 2 (8%)

**Total with disability:** 8 personas (32%)
**Total disabled or carers:** 9 personas (36%)

**Analysis:** Disability representation (32%) exceeds NHS Staff Survey data (25%) and significantly exceeds ESR declarations (5.7%), reflecting intentional overweighting for testing purposes. Includes excellent diversity of disability types: visible and invisible, congenital and acquired, stable and fluctuating.

**Remaining gaps:** No visual impairment/blindness, no learning disability (intellectual/developmental disability - though learning difficulties are well represented), no culturally Deaf perspective.

---

### Sexual Orientation
- **Lesbian, Gay, or Bisexual:** 6 (24%)
  - Gay men (out at work): 2
  - Lesbian (out at work): 1
  - Bisexual women (not out): 2
  - Gay trans man (out at work): 1
- **Heterosexual (stated or implied):** 19 (76%)

**Analysis:** LGB+ representation (24%) is significantly higher than UK population estimates (3-5%) but justified for testing heteronormative assumptions and discrimination. The inclusion of closeted bisexual personas (not out at work) reflects realistic workplace dynamics and bi erasure.

**Remaining gaps:** No trans women, no non-binary representation, no asexual/aromantic representation.

---

### Religion and Belief
- **Muslim:** 3 (12%)
- **Christian:** 3 (12%)
- **Catholic:** 1 (4%) - overlaps with Christian
- **Jewish (secular/cultural):** 1 (4%)
- **Hindu:** 1 (4%)
- **Not stated:** 17 (68%)

**Analysis:** Most personas do not specify religion, which is realistic. Where religion is stated, it connects authentically to cultural heritage (Filipino Catholic, Pakistani Muslim, Ghanaian Christian, etc.). The addition of Jewish representation enables testing of antisemitism.

**Remaining gaps:** No Sikh representation, no Buddhist representation, no explicitly atheist/humanist representation.

---

### Social Class and Education
- **Working class, non-graduate:** 5 (20%)
- **Working class, graduate/migrant route:** 2 (8%)
- **Professional middle class:** 15 (62%)
- **Not specified:** 2 (8%)

**Educational pathways:**
- NVQ/apprenticeship route: 2
- Non-graduate professional: 1
- Nursing diploma: 1
- UK degree: ~15
- International degree: 2
- Postgraduate qualifications: ~8

**Analysis:** Class representation (20% working class) enables testing of class barriers, accent discrimination, and educational assumptions, though underrepresents the actual proportion of working-class staff in support roles. Professional middle-class dominance (62%) reflects the graduate-dominated nature of most framework-relevant roles.

---

### Age Distribution
- **20-29 years:** 5 (20%)
- **30-39 years:** 9 (36%)
- **40-49 years:** 7 (28%)
- **50-59 years:** 3 (12%)
- **60+ years:** 1 (4%)

**Analysis:** Age distribution appropriately concentrates in the 30-49 range (64%), reflecting NHS workforce demographics. The inclusion of one persona aged 60+ (age 63, experiencing ageism) addresses a critical gap and enables testing of age discrimination.

---

### Family and Caring Contexts
- **Single parents:** 2
- **Carers of disabled children:** 2
- **Carers of elderly parents:** 1
- **Married with children:** 6
- **Single:** 4
- **Married/partnered without children specified:** 5
- **Not specified:** 5

**Analysis:** Good diversity of family structures and caring responsibilities, enabling testing of flexible working assumptions and carer support.

---

### Migration Status
- **UK-born, settled:** 20 (83%)
- **International migrants:** 2 (8%) - Filipino (visa-dependent), Hong Kong Chinese (settled)
- **Semi-nomadic community:** 1 (4%) - Irish Traveller

**Analysis:** Migration representation (8%) is lower than the reality of international NHS recruitment but includes critical vulnerability (visa-dependency) and specific cultural contexts.

---

## Intersectionality Highlights

The persona set demonstrates sophisticated intersectional complexity:

1. **Persona 7:** British Pakistani Muslim wheelchair user - triple minoritisation (ethnicity, religion, disability)
2. **Persona 14:** British Chinese autistic woman in male-dominated surgery - navigating model minority stereotypes, gendered culture, and neurodivergence
3. **Persona 15:** Trans man, gay, working class, mental health lived experience - multiple intersecting identities
4. **Persona 4:** British Indian woman with chronic pain/EDS - model minority pressure with invisible disability
5. **Persona 9:** Gay man, deaf/hard of hearing in male-dominated estates role
6. **Persona 21:** Black Ghanaian woman at executive level navigating racism and professional hierarchy
7. **Persona 2:** White Irish Traveller, neurodivergent, working class - most marginalised ethnicity in UK
8. **Persona 18:** Lesbian with late-diagnosed ADHD/dyslexia, carer for elderly mother

## Comparison with NHS Workforce Data

| Characteristic | Persona Set | NHS/UK Data | Assessment |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| BME ethnicity | 48% | 28.6% (NHS) | Intentionally overweighted for testing |
| Disability | 32% | 25% (NHS survey), 5.7% (ESR) | Intentionally overweighted for testing |
| LGB+ | 24% | 3-5% (UK population) | Intentionally overweighted for testing |
| Trans | 4% | ~0.5-1% (UK population) | Above population rate |
| Women | 52% | 77% (NHS overall) | Reflects leadership pipeline |
| Working class | 20% | Unknown (no NHS data) | Sufficient for testing barriers |
| Age 60+ | 4% | ~10% (NHS estimated) | Below but represented |
| Deaf/hard of hearing | 4% | ~11% (UK population) | Below but enables testing |
| Jewish | 4% | ~0.5% (UK population) | Above population rate |
| Muslim | 12% | ~6% (UK population) | Slightly overweighted |

**Rationale:** The persona set is intentionally overweighted in minoritised identities (BME, disabled, LGB+) to ensure modules can be rigorously tested for inclusivity, structural inequality awareness, and transformational learning approaches. This is not intended to match workforce composition but rather to enable comprehensive gap-analysis testing.


---

## Critical Gaps

### High:
1. **Non-binary representation:** No non-binary personas limits testing of non-binary inclusion
2. **Trans women:** Trans masculine experience represented, trans feminine missing

### Medium:
3. **Visual impairment/blindness:** Sensory disability represented (deaf) but not visual
4. **Learning disability:** Only carer perspective represented, not someone with learning disability themselves
5. **Eastern European representation:** Significant NHS workforce component missing
6. **Bangladeshi ethnicity:** Significant UK population not represented
7. **Sikh faith:** Significant NHS workforce group not represented

### For consideration:
8. **Regional specification:** Most personas could be located anywhere
9. **Culturally Deaf perspective:** Persona 9 is audiologically deaf but not Deaf community member
10. **Very young staff:** No personas under 22
11. **Very senior age:** Only one persona 60+

## Version History

- **Version 0.2.4** (26 November 2025): Initial comprehensive diversity analysis based on v0.2.4.

---

## Document Purpose

This document supports:
- Assessment of persona set inclusivity and representativeness
- Identification of gaps in diversity representation
- Planning for persona refinement and expansion
- Demonstration of rigorous approach to authentic representation
- Comparison against NHS workforce equality data (WRES/WDES)

The persona set enables comprehensive testing of whether learning modules genuinely address power dynamics, structural inequalities, and transformational learning rather than offering superficial diversity training.
