# Design Persona: Leadership Development Programme Lead
## Systems Psychodynamic Consultant

**Version:** 1.0

---

## Document Purpose

This design persona represents the leadership development programme lead and systems psychodynamic consultant responsible for testing whether learning modules genuinely address power, difference, inclusion, and transformational learning as specified in the design guidelines. This persona integrates psychodynamic, humanistic, and critical pedagogical approaches to evaluate module design and content.

## Role and Organisational Context

### Title
Leadership Development Programme Lead and Systems Psychodynamic Consultant

### Organisational Position
Operates at the intersection of organisational theory, psychodynamic practice, and educational design. Works as both internal consultant (understanding the system from within) and external critical voice (challenging defences and fantasies that sustain current practice).

### Primary Responsibilities
- Ensuring leadership development interventions transform understanding of authority, role, and unconscious organisational processes
- Testing whether modules genuinely resource transformational learning or reproduce surface-level skills training
- Applying gap-analysis to evaluate whether modules meet Design Principle 10 (power, difference, inclusion as golden thread)
- Evaluating P + Q = L formula implementation (transformational inquiry not just information transfer)
- Maintaining philosophical and ethical foundations amid institutional pressures for measurement and compliance

## Theoretical Foundations Informing Practice

### 1. Psychodynamic Foundations

#### Group Dynamics
Attention to unconscious organisational processes, social defences against anxiety, authority dynamics, and how groups manage emotional work of learning and change. Understanding that organisations deploy defensive routines (splitting, projection, bureaucratisation) to manage anxiety.

#### Key Foci
- **Role and authority**: Personal vs role authority, how social identity shapes both
- **Containment**: Holding anxiety without premature reassurance
- **Social defences**: Challenging organisational defences rather than reproducing them
- **Transference dynamics**: How participants experience the module as authority figure
- **Political unconscious**: What remains unspoken, whose perspectives are excluded

### 2. Humanistic Principles

#### Core Belief
Trust in the actualising tendency, the capacity for self-directed growth when conditions support it. Participants are responsible agents of their own development journey.

#### Conditions for Growth
- **Genuineness**: Acknowledging uncertainty, naming tensions, working transparently
- **Unconditional positive regard**: Each person's development matters regardless of current capability
- **Empathic understanding**: Understanding organisational reality, pressures, defences participants need
- **Trust in actualising tendency**: Given supportive conditions, people move toward growth

### 3. Critical Pedagogy

#### Fundamental Commitment
All education is political, never neutral. Either it supports adaptation to oppressive systems (banking education) or develops capacity to name and transform those systems (problem-posing education).

#### Practice Elements
- **Conscientisation**: Developing critical consciousness about power operations
- **Dialogue**: Co-creating understanding through reflection-action cycles
- **Praxis**: Integration of reflection and action for transformation
- **Liberation as collective**: Individual development connected to systemic change

### 4. Self-Managed Learning

#### Positioning
Participants are architects of their own development. Design conditions that resource learning but refuse to guarantee outcomes. Modules provide provocations and frameworks, but participants determine meaning-making and action.

### 5. Systems Thinking

#### Orientation
Leadership is relationally constituted, not individual trait. Systems are complex, emergent, and resist linear intervention. Attention to how naming reality shapes what becomes possible.

### 6. Experiential Learning

#### Approach
Design for multiple entry points into learning cycles. Some participants need concrete experience first, others theoretical frameworks, still others reflective space or experimentation opportunities.

## Design Testing Focus

### Primary Questions
- Does this module help a white male executive understand how his authority is experienced differently by minoritised staff?
- Will this content challenge a disabled leader's internalised ableism or simply affirm their current position?
- Does this genuinely address structural barriers or does it locate the problem in individual deficit?
- What anxieties does this module defend against rather than process?
- Whose knowledge is privileged and whose is marginalised in the learning design?

### Evaluation Lenses

#### Role and Authority
Does the module help participants understand difference between personal authority and role authority? Does it address how authority is experienced differently based on protected characteristics?

#### Anxiety and Containment
What anxiety does this competency generate? Does the module provide containment without premature reassurance? Can it hold anxiety that genuine change requires mourning what must be relinquished?

#### Social Defences
Does content challenge organisational defences or unconsciously reproduce them? Does "resilience" training defend against acknowledging organisational harm to staff?

#### Transference and Projection
How might participants experience the module as authority figure? What projections might arise? Does design anticipate and work with these rather than deny them?

#### Political Unconscious
What remains unspoken? Whose perspectives are systematically excluded? What fantasies sustain current practice (meritocracy, neutral professionalism)?

---

## Integration Across I-We-It Domains

### I (Internal/Personal) - Depth
Not just conscious self-awareness but unconscious internal world. What motivates beneath what can be named? What defences protect from anxiety? What mourning is required when familiar ways must change? How does social identity shape internal experience?

### We (Relational/Interpersonal) - Depth
Not just interpersonal skills but group dynamics and systemic patterns. How does anxiety move through systems via projective identification? How do power dynamics shape who can speak, whose ideas get taken up, what remains unsayable?

### It (Task/Operational) - Depth
Not just technical effectiveness but connection between task, role, and emotional work required to sustain it. What anxiety does this task generate? How do power structures shape access to resources for task completion?

### Integration
These domains constitute each other. Personal anxiety connects to group dynamics which shapes task performance which generates more anxiety. Test whether modules support working with this complexity or fragment it into disconnected pieces.

---

## Critical Pedagogy Requirements

### Power Naming
- Name power explicitly, not disguise it
- Position learning as political, not neutral
- Create genuine dialogue, not banking education
- Support conscientisation about structural inequalities
- Enable praxis that transforms practice

### Centring Lived Experience of Power and Marginality

**Testing Against:**
- Can a Black woman director use this to navigate structural racism at Board level without being positioned as the problem?
- Does a disabled manager find frameworks addressing systemic barriers or only individual resilience?
- Will a working-class clinical lead encounter class-aware analysis or only middle-class assumptions?
- Does content acknowledge that "leadership presence" is racialised and gendered?

---

## Modular Design Constraints

### Acknowledgment
Two-hour online modules attempting individual learning cannot achieve transformational development. This creates profound constraints.

### Limitations
- **Cannot replace**: Relational challenge required for genuine learning about power and difference
- **Cannot complete**: Learning cycles that require sustained practice over months or years
- **Cannot substitute**: Collective action needed to address systemic issues
- **Risk of harm**: Superficial engagement may offer performative allyship rather than transformation

### Requirements
- Acknowledge limitations honestly without defensiveness
- Refuse false completion while offering genuine resources
- Direct participants explicitly toward richer developmental contexts
- Create productive discomfort rather than premature closure
- Name what cannot be achieved and what harm might result

---

## Reflective Journaling Philosophy

### Positioning
Not module completion requirement but fundamental leadership practice. Journaling provides space for processing emotional complexity, tracking patterns, making meaning, developing capacity for ongoing learning, constructing developmental narratives, working with difficult feelings, noticing triggers and defences.

### Introduction
Modules introduce journaling practice extending far beyond module completion, supporting sustained development.

---

## Peer Learning as Relational Container

### Recognition
Individual learning has inherent limits. Leadership is relational, and learning about leadership must be relational. Design directs participants toward peer learning contexts where different perspectives challenge assumptions, relational dynamics can be examined, support and challenge coexist.

### Attention to Power
Peer learning itself reproduces power dynamics. Test whether modules acknowledge this and provide frameworks for examining and working with these dynamics rather than assuming dialogue is automatically safe or equal.

---

## Evidence Gathering Approach

### Focus Areas
- Whether modules create space for genuine inquiry rather than transmission
- How participants work with discomfort and resistance
- What defensive patterns emerge in response to challenging content
- Whether structural inequalities become visible or remain hidden
- Quality of reflexive practice in participant engagement
- Whether participants develop questions rather than answers
- Whether participants direct themselves toward deeper development contexts

### For Participants
- **Timeframe**: Sustained time (months, years)
- **Sources**: Feedback from differently positioned others, especially those with less power
- **Content**: Documents learning from mistakes not just successes
- **Connection**: Connects to formal assessment frameworks while acknowledging module completion doesn't demonstrate competency

---

## Developmental Stance

### Ongoing Work
- Holding critical distance from institutional pressures for measurement and compliance
- Navigating tensions between supporting individual leaders and challenging organisational defences
- Integrating scholarly rigour with practitioner wisdom
- Working with own countertransference to programme, participants, institutions
- Maintaining philosophical and ethical foundation despite pressure toward instrumental outcomes

### Reflexivity
- What anxiety does this work generate for me?
- What defences do I deploy?
- How does my social location shape what I can see and what remains unconscious?
- Where am I complicit in reproducing what I intend to transform?

---

## Integration as Ongoing Practice

### Commitment
Work integrates psychodynamic attention to unconscious processes with humanistic trust in human capacity, critical analysis of power with compassionate understanding, scholarly rigour with accessible communication, challenge with support. These constitute each other rather than requiring balance.

### Requirements
- Trust in people's capacity alongside recognition of power constraints
- Attention to internal processes alongside analysis of structural barriers
- Immediate empathy alongside long-term systems thinking
- Academic grounding alongside practitioner knowledge

### Acknowledgment
Integration is never complete. Requires ongoing practice, reflexivity, dialogue with others differently positioned, willingness to be wrong, commitment to learning from painful experience of one's own complicity.

---

## Positionality

### Social Location
**Note:** This design persona represents an integrated theoretical approach rather than a specific individual. In practice, the actual consultant/designer would need to name their own social location and how it shapes their work.

### Critical Questions
- How does my race, class, gender, disability status, sexuality shape what I can see?
- What remains unconscious to me based on my privilege?
- How do I work with others differently positioned to challenge my blindnesses?
- Where am I complicit in systems I critique?

---

## Application to Module Design and Testing

This persona serves as the evaluative lens through which all modules must be tested. The consultant asks uncomfortable questions that surface whether modules genuinely address power dynamics and structural inequalities, or whether they reproduce existing patterns under the guise of development.

The integration of theoretical perspectives ensures evaluation attends simultaneously to:
- Unconscious organisational processes and social defences
- Individual agency and capacity for self-direction
- Structural power dynamics and critical consciousness
- Relational complexity and systems thinking
- Multiple entry points and sustained developmental journeys

This prevents modules from fragmenting learning into disconnected competencies or addressing inclusion as add-on rather than golden thread throughout all content.
