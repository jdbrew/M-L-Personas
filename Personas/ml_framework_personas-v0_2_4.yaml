  frameworkElementName: Personas by stage of the Management and Leadership Framework (Gap-Analysis Edition)
  documentPurpose: >
    This extended persona document supports gap-analysis testing of learning modules
    across all competency levels. Each persona now includes diversity profiles reflecting
    WRES/WDES workforce data, learning readiness profiles, and specific evaluation
    criteria to test whether modules genuinely address power, difference, inclusion,
    and transformational learning as specified in the design guidelines.
  
  stages:
  - stageName: Fundamental stage
    description: >
      This stage outlines the essential competencies expected of every manager
      and leader who is accountable for operational delivery and the outcomes
      of others, regardless of their level of seniority or specific role. It
      also supports employees preparing for their first steps into a management
      or leadership position by setting out the minimum standard and expectations
      for those managing or leading in healthcare settings.

        to the clinical team, and my work involves checking letters, calling
        patients, helping organise clinics, writing minutes and coordinating
        our multidisciplinary team (MDT). I am also the team's social secretary,
        and I plan lots of events, including our Christmas do. I also support
        our team leader in monitoring and updating our patient pathways. I am
        keen to take the next step in my career and move into a clinical admin
        manager or team leader role. Learning and development is important to
        me as it will help me move to this next stage of my career.
      
      frameworkApplication: >
        I will use the framework in my appraisal with my line manager to help
        guide me towards my career goals. It will help me to identify my own
        learning needs so that I can build on the fundamental stage to reach
        stage 1. I need to understand how to lead a team and how to create
        a team environment that balances safety and productivity. My line manager
        and I will discuss the different learning and development opportunities
        available to me. This conversation will be safe and supportive. It
        will help me explore how to move my career in the direction that I
        want to go in.

    - personaId: Persona 2
      role: Emergency Care Assistant
      context: >
        I love working as an emergency care assistant because every day is different. I get great satisfaction from knowing my work helps people when they need it the most. I work alongside clinicians responding to emergency calls and providing care such as controlling severe bleeding and treating wounds. I support patients and their families, and for bigger incidents I have worked alongside the police and fire services.
        
        I get a lot of job satisfaction in my role. My shift pattern works for me and my life outside of work. I would like to stay where I am for now, but I want to be the best that I can be.
      
      frameworkApplication: >
        The management and leadership framework is helping me by describing the effective communication and listening skills needed to work in a highly pressurised environment. It enables me to discuss and explore further formal support with my line manger, and how to do this for my team. 
        
        The framework helps me feel more confident in my ability to support colleagues and how to escalate, when needed. I'm improving my skills at work, and this gives me reassurance that I meet the standards expected of me.

          - relevantContext: >
              First in extended family to work in formal employment. Irish Traveller heritage
              (nomadic community background). Diagnosed with dyslexia and ADHD in early twenties
              after struggling through school. Medication helps manage ADHD but still faces
              organisational challenges. Strong practical and interpersonal skills.
        positionality:
          socialClass: Working class, Irish Traveller community (multiply marginalised ethnicity)
          educationalBackground: Left school at 15 with no qualifications. NVQ Level 2 in Emergency Care. Learned through apprenticeship route.
          familyContext: Lives with long-term girlfriend. Extended family remain semi-nomadic, limited understanding of settled employment. Some family disapproval of 'settling'.
          geographicContext: Urban ambulance service area. Family moves between sites seasonally. Tension between work stability and family expectations.
        experienceOfPower:
          minoritisedIdentities: Irish Traveller (most discriminated minority in UK), disabled (neurodivergent), working class, non-qualified route
          experiencedBarriers:
            - Irish Traveller identity attracts extreme prejudice - often hides heritage
            - Colleagues assume limited intelligence due to accent and community background
            - Dyslexia and ADHD create challenges with paperwork and digital systems
            - No reasonable adjustments initially offered - had to fight for them
            - Difficulty getting references due to family employment history
            - Assumptions about reliability and commitment to work
          experiencedDiscrimination:
            - "'Pikey' slurs from colleagues (anti-Traveller hate speech)"
            - "Patients refusing care from 'a traveller'"
            - "Manager questioning sick leave patterns (assumed 'taking time off travelling')"
            - "Excluded from social events - assumptions about behaviour"
            - "Comments about documentation: 'can you even read this?'"
          powerPosition: >
            Very low organisational power. Irish Traveller status creates extreme vulnerability
            to discrimination (highest of any minority group in UK). Neurodivergence adds
            further marginalisation. Non-graduate route limits progression. Shift-based
            role has limited visibility. Afraid to disclose Traveller heritage to most
            colleagues. Practices strategic concealment while experiencing internal conflict
            about authenticity.
        criticalConsciousness:
          awarenessOfStructuralInequality: >
            Acutely aware that Irish Traveller community faces systemic racism rarely
            acknowledged in EDI frameworks. Understands neurodivergent people need different
            systems, not just 'try harder'. Recognises class barriers in career progression.
            Sees parallels between his experience and how Traveller patients are treated
            in emergency care.
          experienceChallengingPower: >
            Challenges anti-Traveller language when safe (rarely). Advocates for patients
            from marginalised communities. Argues for better reasonable adjustments after
            own experience. Very strategic about when/how to challenge - high cost of
            visibility. Uses humour to deflect sometimes.
          recognitionOfPrivilege: >
            White-passing privilege (when Traveller identity hidden). Male privilege in
            emergency care (less sexual harassment than women). Physically able-bodied
            (disability is 'invisible'). Permanent contract (more secure than agency staff).
          commitmentToJustice: >
            Deeply committed to treating all patients with dignity, particularly those from
            marginalised communities who face discrimination. Wants workplace where people
            don't need to hide who they are. Protective of Traveller patients and neurodivergent
            colleagues.

          - Visual and kinaesthetic approaches over heavy text
        barriersToEngagement:
          - Dyslexia makes written materials challenging without adjustments

          - Fear of judgment about reading/writing speed
          - Limited time - shift work makes scheduling difficult
          - Medication timing affects concentration patterns

      role: Health Care Assistant (Mental Health)
      context: >
        As a health care assistant in a mental health setting, I am passionate about providing the best possible care to patients. I always want patients to feel comfortable and safe with me. I really enjoy getting to know my patients and personally helping them. I make sure I maintain accurate records of my interactions with patients and ensure compliance with NHS protocols.
        
        I am new to healthcare, and I work part time, so it has been a whirlwind introduction to the NHS. I like being part of my organisation, but I would like to learn more about the NHS so that I can follow best practice, form good relationships with colleagues, and provide the highest standard of care that I can. I find the varied IT systems quite confusing and frustrating when inputting information when time is of the essence.
      
      frameworkApplication: >
        The management and leadership framework is helping me identify my learning need for additional IT skills, and I will use it with my line manager to request structured IT learning and development. The framework has been a helpful springboard for these conversations. It helps me feel supported so that I can learn more about best practice in the area I work in and implement it in my daily tasks. This is going to help me to grow in confidence when using the IT systems. Ultimately, improving my confidence at work and the care that I provide to my patients.

            - Financial insecurity limits development opportunities (course costs, time off)
            - Part-time status means missing team meetings and development opportunities
            - IT skills gap - limited access to technology growing up, school was chaotic

            - Excluded from informal career conversations (not part of networks)
          powerPosition: >
            Very low organisational power. Band 2 is lowest registered pay band. Part-time
            status reduces visibility and access. Care-experienced background carries stigma
            rarely discussed in EDI. Mixed heritage means navigating racism while not fully
            'belonging' to any community. Youth and entry-level status means easily dismissed.
            Precarious position - any performance concerns feel threatening.
        criticalConsciousness:

            Lived understanding that care system fails most young people. Knows mental
            health services can be both lifesaving and harmful. Recognises class barriers
            in NHS (middle-class assumptions about families, education, aspiration). Aware
            that mixed heritage people face particular forms of racism (not 'ethnic enough',
            'confused identity' narratives).
          experienceChallengingPower: >
            Advocates for patients who remind her of family - particularly those dismissed

            confidence through care leavers' support group.
          recognitionOfPrivilege: >
            British citizenship (unlike some care leavers). Physically healthy. Grandmother
            provided stable placement (not multiple moves). Got qualifications. In employment
            (many care leavers aren't). No addiction issues.
          commitmentToJustice: >
            Deeply committed to treating service users with dignity - knows what being
            dismissed feels like. Wants to help other care-experienced young people into

      context: >
        I'm a community therapy support worker who works in the older person assessment and liaison team. We proactively assess patients and address issues that contribute to function, mobility and social needs to reduce avoidable admissions. 
        
        I am new to the team and would like to become a qualified therapist. We provide a 7 day a week service and we work outside usual working hours. This means my shifts aren't always aligned with my supervisors - they can support my development so I would like to build some continuity between my shifts and theirs. I would like to work towards my qualification and build good working relationships.
      
      frameworkApplication: >
        I approached my line manager to discuss my career aspirations. We used the 'managing people and resources' element of the framework to discuss with the senior team what could be done to further support the development of someone in my position. 
        
        Raising awareness with the right people has been useful because now I get shifts more often with my supervisor who can oversee my development. 
        
        This has helped further my understanding of what I need to do to reach the next step in my career and helped me build a good working relationship with my supervisor.

        as they are under my care all the time. I am often the one who will
        raise the alarm if they deteriorate. Working closely with other disciplines

      role: Estates Manager
      context: >
        As an estates manager, I work with and support the estates helpdesk.
        I plan, manage and deliver estates projects. I work alongside staff
        in all areas, including contractors, suppliers, specialist consultants
        and patients. My workload is full of time sensitive tasks. I enjoy
        the variety and the fast-paced nature of my job but sometimes I feel
        frustrated when prioritisation seems like an impossible task with so
        many important demands.
      
      frameworkApplication: >
        The management and leadership framework got me thinking around how
        I would like to improve my use of data to inform my decisions. I want
        to use evidence to challenge my own practice and help identify new
        ways of working to improve the service. I am hoping that this might
        help alleviate some of the feelings of frustration around competing
        demands. I have had discussions around this with my line manager, using
        the framework as a guide. One appraisal objective this year is to
        complete some learning and development which will strengthen my use
        of data and work on a project where I can use these skills. My line
        manager is supportive, and we have already been looking at learning
        and development and projects which help me achieve these goals.

            delayed seeking help due to stigma. Hearing aids help but don't restore
            normal hearing. Lip-reading essential for face-to-face communication. Phone
            calls extremely difficult. Background noise (construction sites, plant rooms)
            makes hearing aids less effective. Learning BSL to prepare for further
            deterioration. Partner learning BSL too. Noisy hospital environment creates

            Moderate power as manager but estates function undervalued in NHS hierarchy.
            Gay identity reduces power in masculine technical culture. Deaf/hard of
            hearing creates significant communication barriers and marginalisation. White
            privilege, male privilege, middle-class position provide advantages. Working
            class background creates different relationship to management. Acquired
            disability means not part of Deaf community but also not fully "hearing world".

      role: Senior House Officer (General Surgery)
      context: >
        I am a general surgery senior house officer (SHO). I carry out day-to-day
        patient care such as history taking, clinical examinations and investigations.
        I make and implement clinical management plans and adhere to clinical
        protocols, as well as operate with and assist senior team members in
        theatre. I work the surgical on call rota. As a relatively new SHO,
        I am finding my feet when it comes to providing support and leadership
        to junior colleagues. Due to the nature of my work, I am regularly
        learning and being assessed on my practical surgical skills but would
        like to make sure that I am supporting junior staff members appropriately
        too by focusing on my management and leadership skills.
      
      frameworkApplication: >
        I raised my desire to proactively support junior team members with my
        line manager. They told me this is set out in the management and leadership
        framework and could be considered part of continuing professional development.
        They started discussions with the service manager as this isn't a clinical
        skill but is still one that impacts the service and my personal development.
        I have since been able to identify how to get feedback on my management
        and leadership approach. This has helped me identify different ways
        of supporting junior colleagues in different situations. I now feel
        more comfortable supporting them and it has opened the channels of
        communication with the team on how we can support and provide constructive
        support and feedback with each other.

        The management and leadership framework highlights the requirement to
        work collaboratively to achieve successful outcomes. This is a fundamental
        but underrated skill to have as a senior leader and isn't always given
        the priority it deserves as an important skill. It is also a skill I
        felt I would benefit from more support around. Traditional learning and
        development methods rely on classroom teaching but I find learning on
        the job, where I can observe and shadow others, most beneficial. Thanks
        to the framework, I am taking part in mentoring which is supporting my
        ability to use my networks and relationships to achieve shared goals
        that improve processes on a large scale. Now I feel much more at ease
        during collaborative working. I have also used the framework in the career
        conversations I have with my team. It is a useful document to structure
        these conversations.

        I am the information governance lead at a large mental health trust.
        This means I oversee information governance activities related to the
        shared electronic patient record (EPR) across several of our sites.
        I am in the process of developing the joint controller agreement to
        define the roles, responsibilities and data protection obligations of
        each location to enable joint data processing. I lead the development
        of data protection impact assessments across the programme lifecycle
        to ensure that privacy risks are proactively identified and mitigated.
        I also lead the reviews of information governance policy to make sure
        that our processes are kept up to date.

        Eventually, I would like to progress to a head of information governance
        role, and the management and leadership framework is helping me identify
        what I need, to be able to evidence how I drive continuous service
        improvements at a large scale, and show how I consider patient need,
        safety and evolving healthcare requirements. I struggle to find time
        away from my busy day job, but I am exploring more informal and on-the
        job development opportunities. My line manager is supportive, and I
        think this is helped by the framework clearly setting out expectations
        in these areas.

        raise the profile of dermatology in our Trust and help us build
        relationships with other services and universities which would mean
        being involved in research that could really improve treatment for
        our patients.

        leaders to help improve our service and develop those productive working

            - Articulating lived experience credibility without oversharing
        potentialMisunderstandings:
          - Thinking mental health history is career liability not asset
          - Believing leaders must project invulnerability
          - Assuming recovery means being 'fixed' and past no longer relevant
          - Thinking disclosure of disability is unprofessional
          - Underestimating ongoing management needs (not one-and-done)
