> **Persona ID:** Persona 2
> **Purpose:** Links to testing criteria files and competency assessments

*Establishes organizational context and level of responsibility*

I love working as an emergency care assistant because every day is different. I get great satisfaction from knowing my work helps people when they need it the most. I work alongside clinicians responding to emergency calls and providing care such as controlling severe bleeding and treating wounds. I support patients and their families, and for bigger incidents I have worked alongside the police and fire services.

I get a lot of job satisfaction in my role. My shift pattern works for me and my life outside of work. I would like to stay where I am for now, but I want to be the best that I can be.

### Framework Application

The management and leadership framework is helping me by describing the effective communication and listening skills needed to work in a highly pressurised environment. It enables me to discuss and explore further formal support with my line manger, and how to do this for my team.

The framework helps me feel more confident in my ability to support colleagues and how to escalate, when needed. I'm improving my skills at work, and this gives me reassurance that I meet the standards expected of me.

- **Geographic Context:** Urban ambulance service area. Family moves between sites seasonally. Tension between work stability and family expectations.

#### Experience of Power
- **Minoritised Identities:** Irish Traveller (most discriminated minority in UK), disabled (neurodivergent), working class, non-qualified route
- **Experienced Barriers:**
  - Irish Traveller identity attracts extreme prejudice - often hides heritage
  - Colleagues assume limited intelligence due to accent and community background
  - Dyslexia and ADHD create challenges with paperwork and digital systems
  - No reasonable adjustments initially offered - had to fight for them

Neurodivergence adds further marginalisation. Non-graduate route limits progression. Shift-based role has limited visibility. Afraid to disclose Traveller heritage to most colleagues. Practices strategic concealment while experiencing internal conflict about authenticity.

#### Critical Consciousness
- **Awareness of Structural Inequality:** Acutely aware that Irish Traveller community faces systemic racism rarely acknowledged in EDI frameworks.

## Persona 3: Health Care Assistant (Mental Health)

> **Persona ID:** Persona 3
> **Purpose:** Links to testing criteria files and competency assessments

### Role Context

*Establishes organizational context and level of responsibility*

As a health care assistant in a mental health setting, I am passionate about providing the best possible care to patients. I always want patients to feel comfortable and safe with me. I really enjoy getting to know my patients and personally helping them. I make sure I maintain accurate records of my interactions with patients and ensure compliance with NHS protocols.

I am new to healthcare, and I work part time, so it has been a whirlwind introduction to the NHS. I like being part of my organisation, but I would like to learn more about the NHS so that I can follow best practice, form good relationships with colleagues, and provide the highest standard of care that I can. I find the varied IT systems quite confusing and frustrating when inputting information when time is of the essence.

### Framework Application

*Shows real-world application of framework and learning approach*

The management and leadership framework is helping me identify my learning need for additional IT skills, and I will use it with my line manager to request structured IT learning and development. The framework has been a helpful springboard for these conversations. It helps me feel supported so that I can learn more about best practice in the area I work in and implement it in my daily tasks. This is going to help me to grow in confidence when using the IT systems. Ultimately, improving my confidence at work and the care that I provide to my patients.

### Diversity Profile

Youth and entry-level status means easily dismissed. Precarious position - any performance concerns feel threatening.

#### Critical Consciousness
- **Awareness of Structural Inequality:** Lived understanding that care system fails most young people. Knows mental health services can be both lifesaving and harmful. Recognises class barriers in NHS (middle-class assumptions about families, education, aspiration). Aware that mixed heritage people face particular forms of racism (not 'ethnic enough', 'confused identity' narratives).

## Persona 4: Community Therapy Support Worker

> **Persona ID:** Persona 4
> **Purpose:** Links to testing criteria files and competency assessments

### Role Context

*Establishes organizational context and level of responsibility*

I'm a community therapy support worker who works in the older person assessment and liaison team. We proactively assess patients and address issues that contribute to function, mobility and social needs to reduce avoidable admissions.

I am new to the team and would like to become a qualified therapist. We provide a 7 day a week service and we work outside usual working hours. This means my shifts aren't always aligned with my supervisors - they can support my development so I would like to build some continuity between my shifts and theirs. I would like to work towards my qualification and build good working relationships.

### Framework Application

*Shows real-world application of framework and learning approach*

I approached my line manager to discuss my career aspirations. We used the 'managing people and resources' element of the framework to discuss with the senior team what could be done to further support the development of someone in my position.

Raising awareness with the right people has been useful because now I get shifts more often with my supervisor who can oversee my development.

This has helped further my understanding of what I need to do to reach the next step in my career and helped me build a good working relationship with my supervisor.

### Diversity Profile

> **Critical for Design Principle 10:** Difference, diversity, inclusion, and power as golden thread

#### Protected Characteristics
- **Identity:** British Indian woman, age 27, disabled (chronic pain condition - hypermobility EDS)
- **Relevant Context:** Diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hypermobility type) age 24 after years of being told pain was 'psychosomatic'. Condition causes chronic pain, fatigue, and joint instability. Uses mobility aids intermittently (stick, wheelchair on bad days).

British Indian heritage means some professional expectations but also face racism. Disability creates significant vulnerability - reasonable adjustments depend on manager's understanding. Support worker role (not qualified therapist) limits authority. Aspiration to qualify means navigating ableist assumptions about disability and professional capability.

#### Critical Consciousness
- **Awareness of Structural Inequality:** Understands that medical model of disability creates barriers (services designed for non-disabled workers). Recognises that disability intersects with race and gender (assumptions about South Asian women and pain, 'model minority' stereotypes).

  - Each persona generates testing criteria in the stage-appropriate file

- **ml_modular_logic_model-v1_0.yaml**
  - Defines what modular learning CAN and CANNOT achieve

### How Personas Generate Testing Criteria

1. **personaId, role, diversityContext** → identification in testing file
2. **diversityProfile** → generates moduleEvaluationQuestions
3. **targetCompetencies** → generates moduleTestingScenarios
4. **learningReadiness + competencyDevelopmentProfile** → ensures realistic scope
5. **All sections together** → ensure power and difference as golden thread

### Design Principles Embedded in These Personas

- **Principle 10:** Power and difference as golden thread (diversityProfile)
- **P + Q = L:** Transformational not just informational (criticalConsciousness)
- **I-We-It integration** (diversityProfile + competencyDevelopmentProfile)
- **Accessibility and inclusion** (learningReadiness, diversityProfile)
- **Evidence gathering support** (evidenceGatheringCapacity)
- **Acknowledgment of limitations** (contextualConstraints, barriersToEngagement)
