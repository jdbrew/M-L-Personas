**Version:** 0.2.3

## Document Purpose

This extended persona document supports gap-analysis testing of learning modules across all competency levels. Each persona now includes diversity profiles reflecting WRES/WDES workforce data, learning readiness profiles, and specific evaluation criteria to test whether modules genuinely address power, difference, inclusion, and transformational learning as specified in the design guidelines.

## Stage 3: Senior managers and leaders

### Stage Description

This stage supports senior managers and leaders operating at divisional, directorate, or senior operational level. These individuals shape strategic direction for their area, work across organisational boundaries, influence system-level decisions, and hold significant organisational authority. They lead multiple functions or services and are accountable for major aspects of organisational performance.

## Persona 17: Assistant Director of Finance

### Role Context

As the assistant director of finance at an acute trust I oversee all aspects of financial management functions. This includes monthly financial reporting, effective budgetary control, annual forecasting and longer-term planning, maintenance of financial systems and the continued development of service line reporting and patient level information costing systems. I support the wider leadership team across the directorate and deputise for the chief financial officer as required.

### Framework Application

The management and leadership framework highlights the requirement to work collaboratively to achieve successful outcomes. This is a fundamental but underrated skill to have as a senior leader and isn't always given the priority it deserves as an important skill. It is also a skill I felt I would benefit from more support around. Traditional learning and development methods rely on classroom teaching but I find learning on the job, where I can observe and shadow others, most beneficial. Thanks to the framework, I am taking part in mentoring which is supporting my ability to use my networks and relationships to achieve shared goals that improve processes on a large scale. Now I feel much more at ease during collaborative working. I have also used the framework in the career conversations I have with my team. It is a useful document to structure these conversations.

## Persona 18: Primary Care Practice Manager

### Role Context

I am a primary care practice manager, and it is my job to work with operational partners to drive our expansion plans. I am currently leading on the practice relocation which will double capacity in our group of GP practices. My aim is to establish operations across our multiple locations and continue to oversee the day-to-day operations. Essentially, I support and oversee all aspects of running the practices to allow clinicians to focus purely on exceptional patient care. I have recently started working part time (20 hours per week) which allows me a better work / life balance, but I want to continue to support my team effectively on reduced hours. Given the significant amount of organisational change within our group of GP practices, I want to find a new approach to leading people through change, particularly around addressing barriers and resistance to change as some of our practice staff have been working as a single unit for many years.

### Framework Application

The management and leadership framework emphasises change management and conflict resolution and clearly sets out expectations of me in these areas and at my level. This has allowed me to identify where I could develop, and to access learning and development aligned with the framework on how to navigate organisational change and ultimately help support staff through this change process better.

## Persona 19: Information Governance Lead

### Role Context

I am the information governance lead at a large mental health trust. This means I oversee information governance activities related to the shared electronic patient record (EPR) across several of our sites. I am in the process of developing the joint controller agreement to define the roles, responsibilities and data protection obligations of each location to enable joint data processing. I lead the development of data protection impact assessments across the programme lifecycle to ensure that privacy risks are proactively identified and mitigated. I also lead the reviews of information governance policy to make sure that our processes are kept up to date.

### Framework Application

Eventually, I would like to progress to a head of information governance role, and the management and leadership framework is helping me identify what I need, to be able to evidence how I drive continuous service improvements at a large scale, and show how I consider patient need, safety and evolving healthcare requirements. I struggle to find time away from my busy day job, but I am exploring more informal and on-the job development opportunities. My line manager is supportive, and I think this is helped by the framework clearly setting out expectations in these areas.

## Persona 20: Primary Care Operations Lead (ICB)

### Role Context

I am the Primary Care Operations Lead in an ICB. This is my first role in the NHS and although I have experience from working in healthcare abroad, I have limited experience of completing formal leadership or management training. My Primary Care Team prides itself in holding co-operative and collaborative relationships with our providers. We champion co-production across internal and external partners.

### Framework Application

I used the Framework during my induction. It provided me with a description of what was expected of me as a leader and manager in the NHS. Through discussions with my line manager, we identified that I needed greater knowledge of national standards and regulations, so I have undertaken some training to understand them more. I have also worked with partners from other professionals across the ICB, so I know what policies and governance they work towards. This broader understanding will make sure we work together effectively.

## Persona 21: Chief Allied Health Professional

### Role Context

I am the chief allied health professional, and I am responsible for the oversight of clinical professions and person-centred care across acute, community, mental health and primary care. I unify clinical leadership across allied health professionals to ensure that professional standards, regulatory compliance and strategic ambitions are delivered in alignment with national policy, regional priorities and local population needs.
I have worked my way up in many different roles and I think this gives me a good understanding of what is important to colleagues who work in different environments delivering patient care. In every role I have worked in safety has always been important to me and my colleagues as well as the ability to raise concerns when they arise.

### Framework Application

As I oversee colleagues in a variety of workplaces, I am invested in ensuring that we prioritise the physical and psychological safety of colleagues in each of these settings. I want to ensure that staff feel comfortable to speak up about concerns when they arise and make sure that they know they will be supported, and the process will be handled effectively and sensitively.
I'm using the framework, particularly competencies around responding to patient safety concerns, as leverage to enquire about safety and 'speaking-up' incidents that have happened so that we can work on learning from past events.

Workforce planning and development. Quality improvement and patient safety. Equity and inclusion frameworks (WRES, WDES). System leadership and ICS structures. Strategic planning and delivery. Stakeholder engagement. NHS governance and compliance.
- **Gaps:** Navigating Board-level politics as minoritised leader. Building influence at national policy level. Sustainability and system transformation at scale. Managing own wellbeing under extreme pressure. Addressing racism at organisational culture level.

#### Contextual Constraints
- **Time Available:** 2-3 hours weekly maximum (often less due to crisis management)
- **System Pressures:** Workforce shortages across AHP disciplines. Financial pressures affecting services. Organisational change and ICS development. Competing demands from multiple stakeholders. Crisis management taking precedence over strategic work. Discrimination and microaggressions creating emotional labour.
- **Support Available:** CEO supportive but limited understanding of race equity issues. Some Board allies. Regional AHP Chief network. Black NHS leaders network. Family and church community for personal support.

#### Evidence Gathering Capacity
- **Can Demonstrate:**
  - Strategic AHP workforce development and transformation
  - Professional standards implementation and compliance
  - Equity and inclusion initiatives and WRES improvement
  - Cross-system collaboration and partnership working
  - Patient safety and quality improvement at scale
- **Needs Support:**
  - Evidencing cultural change (slow, hard to measure)
  - Demonstrating impact of equity work in traditional metrics
  - Capturing leadership in responding to discrimination
  - Articulating emotional labour of minoritised leadership

#### Potential Misunderstandings
- Thinking leadership excellence requires conforming to white norms
- Assuming assertiveness from Black women is aggression
- Believing equity work is separate from operational excellence
- Thinking single parents cannot handle executive demands
- Assuming lived experience of discrimination is bias not insight

### Peer Learning Context

#### Availability
- **Mentor Access:** Mentors many Black and minoritised staff. Could benefit from coaching from someone understanding intersectional leadership challenges. Limited access to peers at same level with shared experience.

- **Peer Groups:** Regional Chief AHP network, Black NHS leaders network, professional body networks. Could benefit from action learning set with other minoritised executive leaders.

- **Colleague Support:** Some Board colleagues supportive but don't fully understand race equity challenges. Strong network of AHP leaders across region. Church community provides personal support.


#### Willingness to Engage
- **Comfort:** Comfortable in professional leadership discussions. More cautious about vulnerability around race experiences (depends on safety of space).

- **Time Commitment:** Willing to commit to high-value learning. Must be flexible for parenting responsibilities.

- **Vulnerability:** Will share strategic challenges readily. More selective about sharing experiences of racism (depends on who's in room and whether they'll understand or minimise). Guards against being seen as "playing race card".


### Developmental Trajectory

**Coming From:** Senior AHP clinician who has navigated racism and structural barriers throughout career. Developed strategic leadership skills through lived experience of system inequities. Used positional power to advocate for minoritised staff and patients.

**Heading Toward:** Aspiring to CEO or Chief People Officer role in next 3-5 years to drive organisational culture change at highest level. Want to influence national AHP strategy and NHS race equity policy. Long-term aspiration to leave legacy of more inclusive NHS leadership and visible Black women in executive roles.

**Motivations:**
- Breaking barriers for next generation of Black professionals
- Elevating AHP professions to equal status with medicine/nursing
- Driving racial justice and equity in NHS
- Ensuring person-centred care that addresses health inequalities
- Being visible role model for Black girls and young women
- Using faith-driven commitment to service and justice
- Honouring parents' sacrifices by achieving at highest level

## Persona 22: Specialist Doctor in Dermatology

### Role Context

I'm a specialist doctor in dermatology, running adult and paediatric outpatient clinics for routine and urgent appointments. I carry out minor operations for outpatients and actively participate in our multidisciplinary team for complex patients. I teach, train and supervise junior medical staff. Since specialising I have realised that I am increasingly passionate about how we run the service and how to develop it to improve better patient outcomes. I have some ideas which would raise the profile of dermatology in our Trust and help us build relationships with other services and universities which would mean being involved in research that could really improve treatment for our patients.

### Framework Application

The framework was useful to me, and I used the areas that discussed improvement of care and patient outcomes as the foundation to pitch my service development ideas. I am now working closely with other leaders to help improve our service and develop those productive working relationships. This goes to show how important it is that we have colleagues from different staff groups involved in service development and I am proud to be contributing to this for dermatology patients.
