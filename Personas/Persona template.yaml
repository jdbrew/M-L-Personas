# Persona Template - Documentation Guide

# This template creates diverse, realistic personas for testing online learning content
# against the Management and Leadership Framework competencies. Each section serves
# a specific purpose in ensuring learning modules are inclusive, accessible, and
# transformational rather than purely informational.

---

# BASIC IDENTIFICATION
- personaId: "[Unique identifier, e.g., Persona 17]"
  # Purpose: Links this persona to testing criteria files and competency assessments
  # Used in: ml_framework_module_testing_criteria-[stage].yaml files

  role: "[Professional role/job title]"
  # Purpose: Establishes the organizational context and level of responsibility
  # Links to: Stage-appropriate competencies in ml_framework_standards-competencies-v1_0.yaml
  # Example: "Assistant Director of Finance", "Ward Sister", "Healthcare Assistant"

  # NARRATIVE CONTEXT
  context: >
    [First-person narrative describing the role, responsibilities, and work context.
    This should paint a realistic picture of daily work, challenges, and organizational
    position. Include specific work activities, scope of responsibility, and key
    relationships in the organization.]
  # Purpose: Provides realistic grounding for evaluating whether learning content
  # addresses actual work contexts and pressures
  # Testing use: Ensures modules connect theory to real workplace scenarios

  frameworkApplication: >
    [First-person narrative describing how this person has engaged with or would
    engage with the Management and Leadership Framework. Include learning preferences,
    barriers faced, what's working, and specific competencies being developed.
    Should reflect authentic voice and mixed feelings where appropriate.]
  # Purpose: Shows real-world application of framework and learning approach
  # Links to: competencyDevelopmentProfile section below
  # Testing use: Validates that modules support diverse learning approaches and
  # acknowledge real barriers to engagement

  # DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION PROFILE
  # This section is CRITICAL for Design Principle 10: "Difference, diversity,
  # inclusion, and power as golden thread"

  diversityProfile:
    protectedCharacteristics:
      - characteristic: "[Concise summary of identity markers including race, ethnicity,
          gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, religion, etc.]"

      - relevantContext: >
          [Detailed context about background, immigration history, family context,
          cultural practices, visible/invisible aspects of identity. Should provide
          depth without stereotyping.]
        # Purpose: Ensures testing catches content that assumes white, able-bodied,
        # heterosexual, Christian, British-born perspectives as default

    positionality:
      # These fields map social position and access to resources/power

# HOW THIS PERSONA GENERATES TESTING CRITERIA
#
# Each persona in this format is used to create testing criteria in the
# ml_framework_module_testing_criteria-[stage].yaml files:
#
# 1. personaId, role, diversityContext → identification in testing file
#
# 2. diversityProfile → generates moduleEvaluationQuestions like:
#    - Does module address [power dynamic from experiencedBarriers]?
#    - Does module recognize [structural issue from awarenessOfStructuralInequality]?
#    - Will this help me [challenge from experienceChallengingPower]?
#
# 3. targetCompetencies → generates moduleTestingScenarios with:
#    - competency: [name from targetCompetencies]
#    - testQuestion: Does module address [gap] while acknowledging [barrier]?
#    - evaluationCriteria: Specific things module must include
#
# 4. learningReadiness + competencyDevelopmentProfile → ensures evaluationCriteria
#    respect realistic scope of modular learning (from ml_modular_logic_model-v1_0.yaml)
#
# 5. All sections together → ensure Design Principle 10 (power and difference as
#    golden thread) is genuinely embedded in testing, not just aspirational
#
# The testing criteria validate whether learning modules:
# - Address power, not ignore it (from experienceOfPower)
# - Support diverse learning approaches (from learningPreferences)
# - Acknowledge constraints (from contextualConstraints, barriersToEngagement)
# - Build on existing knowledge (from priorKnowledge)
# - Support evidence gathering (from evidenceGatheringCapacity)
# - Connect to real work contexts (from context, frameworkApplication)
# - Are accessible and inclusive (from diversityProfile, accessToLearning)
# - Support transformational learning (from criticalConsciousness)

# RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER FRAMEWORK DOCUMENTS
#
# ml_framework_standards-competencies-v1_0.yaml
#   - Source of truth for competency names and stage-appropriate descriptors
#   - targetCompetencies must reference exact competency names from this file
#   - Stage level determines complexity expectations in testing scenarios
#
# ml_framework_module_testing_criteria-[stage].yaml
#   - OUTPUT: Each persona generates testing criteria in appropriate stage file
#   - Uses personaId, role, diversityContext for identification
#   - Transforms diversity profile into evaluation questions
#   - Transforms target competencies into testing scenarios
#
# ml_modular_logic_model-v1_0.yaml
#   - Defines what modular learning CAN and CANNOT achieve
#   - Testing criteria must respect these boundaries (G,H,I,J vs K)
#   - Ensures evaluationCriteria are realistic for modular format
#
# Design Principles (referenced in testing criteria documentation)
#   - Principle 10: Power and difference as golden thread → diversityProfile required
#   - P + Q = L formula: Transformational not just informational → criticalConsciousness
#   - I-We-It integration → diversityProfile + competencyDevelopmentProfile
#   - Accessibility and inclusion → learningReadiness, diversityProfile
#   - Evidence gathering support → evidenceGatheringCapacity
#   - Acknowledgment of limitations → contextualConstraints, barriersToEngagement
