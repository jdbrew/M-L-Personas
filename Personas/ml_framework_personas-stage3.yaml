  frameworkElementName: Personas by stage of the Management and Leadership Framework (Gap-Analysis Edition)
  documentPurpose: >
    This extended persona document supports gap-analysis testing of learning modules
    across all competency levels. Each persona now includes diversity profiles reflecting
    WRES/WDES workforce data, learning readiness profiles, and specific evaluation
    criteria to test whether modules genuinely address power, difference, inclusion,
    and transformational learning as specified in the design guidelines.
  
  stages:
  - stageName: 'Stage 3: Senior managers and leaders'
    description: >
      This stage supports senior managers and leaders operating at divisional,
      directorate, or senior operational level. These individuals shape strategic
      direction for their area, work across organisational boundaries, influence
      system-level decisions, and hold significant organisational authority.
      They lead multiple functions or services and are accountable for major
      aspects of organisational performance.

      role: Assistant Director of Finance
      context: >
        As the assistant director of finance at an acute trust I oversee all
        aspects of financial management functions. This includes monthly financial
        reporting, effective budgetary control, annual forecasting and longer-term
        planning, maintenance of financial systems and the continued development
        of service line reporting and patient level information costing systems.
        I support the wider leadership team across the directorate and deputise
        for the chief financial officer as required.
      
      frameworkApplication: >
        The management and leadership framework highlights the requirement to
        work collaboratively to achieve successful outcomes. This is a fundamental
        but underrated skill to have as a senior leader and isn't always given
        the priority it deserves as an important skill. It is also a skill I
        felt I would benefit from more support around. Traditional learning and
        development methods rely on classroom teaching but I find learning on
        the job, where I can observe and shadow others, most beneficial. Thanks
        to the framework, I am taking part in mentoring which is supporting my
        ability to use my networks and relationships to achieve shared goals
        that improve processes on a large scale. Now I feel much more at ease
        during collaborative working. I have also used the framework in the career
        conversations I have with my team. It is a useful document to structure
        these conversations.

          Chief Financial Officer or executive director role. Want to demonstrate

      role: Primary Care Practice Manager
      context: >
        I am a primary care practice manager, and it is my job to work with
        operational partners to drive our expansion plans. I am currently
        leading on the practice relocation which will double capacity in our
        group of GP practices. My aim is to establish operations across our
        multiple locations and continue to oversee the day-to-day operations.
        Essentially, I support and oversee all aspects of running the practices
        to allow clinicians to focus purely on exceptional patient care. I
        have recently started working part time (20 hours per week) which
        allows me a better work / life balance, but I want to continue to
        support my team effectively on reduced hours. Given the significant
        amount of organisational change within our group of GP practices, I
        want to find a new approach to leading people through change, particularly
        around addressing barriers and resistance to change as some of our
        practice staff have been working as a single unit for many years.
      
      frameworkApplication: >
        The management and leadership framework emphasises change management
        and conflict resolution and clearly sets out expectations of me in
        these areas and at my level. This has allowed me to identify where
        I could develop, and to access learning and development aligned with
        the framework on how to navigate organisational change and ultimately
        help support staff through this change process better.

        I am the information governance lead at a large mental health trust.
        This means I oversee information governance activities related to the
        shared electronic patient record (EPR) across several of our sites.
        I am in the process of developing the joint controller agreement to
        define the roles, responsibilities and data protection obligations of
        each location to enable joint data processing. I lead the development
        of data protection impact assessments across the programme lifecycle
        to ensure that privacy risks are proactively identified and mitigated.
        I also lead the reviews of information governance policy to make sure
        that our processes are kept up to date.
      
      frameworkApplication: >
        Eventually, I would like to progress to a head of information governance
        role, and the management and leadership framework is helping me identify
        what I need, to be able to evidence how I drive continuous service
        improvements at a large scale, and show how I consider patient need,
        safety and evolving healthcare requirements. I struggle to find time
        away from my busy day job, but I am exploring more informal and on-the
        job development opportunities. My line manager is supportive, and I
        think this is helped by the framework clearly setting out expectations
        in these areas.

        knowledge of national standards and regulations, so I have undertaken

            experiences of racism (depends on who's in room and whether they'll
            understand or minimise). Guards against being seen as "playing race card".

      role: Specialist Doctor in Dermatology
      context: >
        I'm a specialist doctor in dermatology, running adult and paediatric
        outpatient clinics for routine and urgent appointments. I carry out
        minor operations for outpatients and actively participate in our
        multidisciplinary team for complex patients. I teach, train and supervise
        junior medical staff. Since specialising I have realised that I am
        increasingly passionate about how we run the service and how to develop
        it to improve better patient outcomes. I have some ideas which would
        raise the profile of dermatology in our Trust and help us build
        relationships with other services and universities which would mean
        being involved in research that could really improve treatment for
        our patients.
      
      frameworkApplication: >
        The framework was useful to me, and I used the areas that discussed
        improvement of care and patient outcomes as the foundation to pitch
        my service development ideas. I am now working closely with other
        leaders to help improve our service and develop those productive working
        relationships. This goes to show how important it is that we have
        colleagues from different staff groups involved in service development
        and I am proud to be contributing to this for dermatology patients.

            - Racist comments from patients refusing care
            - Assumptions about capability despite consultant status
            - Tone policing when assertive
