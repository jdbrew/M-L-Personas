## Persona 10: Strategic Commissioning Manager

### Role Context

I work as a strategic commissioning manager in an integrated care board. A lot of my work is around overseeing and managing healthcare contracts. I support the team in negotiating, developing and documenting contracts. I like the fact that there is such a variety of different tasks that go into contract management. I have worked in this role for around 7 years and in other roles in the NHS for many more years. I currently work full time, but I am considering what the next steps are for me around reducing my hours and retirement.

### Framework Application

I would really like to be upskilled in how I can demonstrate value for money. The management and leadership framework is helping me make a case to refresh my knowledge. I am exploring mentoring opportunities to achieve this. This will benefit me, but it will also help me give assurance to colleagues and the taxpayer that money is being spent responsibly. As a manager, I have also worked to create development plans for my team and have used the Framework as a starting point for these conversations.

## Persona 11: HR Manager

### Role Context

I am a HR manager. I manage a small specialist HR team to make sure that HR issues are fully considered and managed before, during and after they arise, and that we are compliant with employment law. I specifically provide HR advice around organisational change, and I do everything I can to deliver comprehensive and proactive operational HR support. I am new to the NHS and work a four-day week on condensed hours which helps with my childcare commitments. However, getting time away from work for learning and development is difficult as my days are jam packed. I prefer learning online in small, bite-sized chunks that I can fit around my busy schedule.

## Persona 14: Senior House Officer (General Surgery)

### Role Context

I am a general surgery senior house officer (SHO). I carry out day-to-day patient care such as history taking, clinical examinations and investigations. I make and implement clinical management plans and adhere to clinical protocols, as well as operate with and assist senior team members in theatre. I work the surgical on call rota. As a relatively new SHO, I am finding my feet when it comes to providing support and leadership to junior colleagues. Due to the nature of my work, I am regularly learning and being assessed on my practical surgical skills but would like to make sure that I am supporting junior staff members appropriately too by focusing on my management and leadership skills.

### Framework Application

I raised my desire to proactively support junior team members with my line manager. They told me this is set out in the management and leadership framework and could be considered part of continuing professional development. They started discussions with the service manager as this isn't a clinical skill but is still one that impacts the service and my personal development. I have since been able to identify how to get feedback on my management and leadership approach. This has helped me identify different ways of supporting junior colleagues in different situations. I now feel more comfortable supporting them and it has opened the channels of communication with the team on how we can support and provide constructive support and feedback with each other.

## Persona 15: Lead Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner

### Role Context

As a lead psychological wellbeing practitioner I provide clinical leadership and nurture the professional growth of my psychological wellbeing practitioner team. We improve access to mental health support by providing low intensity clinical interventions to our patients. I lead on delivery by supporting my team to provide services that suit patient need and preference (remote, face to face, group therapy). I also ensure timely access to support for patients. My team are geographically dispersed, and I work flexibly across a range of sites travelling between them to ensure hands on leadership. Our services are in high demand. My team deal with the mental health of our patients every day with increasing workloads but there is more that we can do to support their personal wellbeing.

### Framework Application

The framework includes safety and wellbeing so I included this element of the framework when I raised my concerns with our service management team. The framework helped me show that this is a priority area for the whole NHS. Since then, we have been working on new pathways for specialist support for staff should they need it. I am hoping that if this is successful in my team then other psychological wellbeing practitioner teams might also choose to implement something similar.
