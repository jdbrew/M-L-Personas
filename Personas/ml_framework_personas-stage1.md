# Management and Leadership Framework - Stage 1 Personas

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Updated:** 2025-11-26

## Document Purpose

These personas support testing of Stage 1 learning modules across all competencies. Each persona includes comprehensive diversity profiles reflecting WRES/WDES workforce data, learning readiness profiles, and specific evaluation criteria to test whether modules genuinely address power, difference, inclusion, and transformational learning as specified in the design guidelines. Personas are designed to ensure modules are inclusive, accessible, and transformational rather than purely informational.

## Stage 1: New and first-line managers and leaders

### Stage Description

This stage supports individuals in their first supervisory, leadership, or management role, typically with responsibility for just one team or line of accountability. The competencies help new, and first-line managers and leaders understand what is expected of them as they begin to take responsibility for the work of others, in addition to their own.

## Persona 5: Senior Community Speech and Language Therapist

### Role Context

As a senior community speech and language therapist, I mostly manage my caseload in the community autonomously. I assess, diagnose and manage the treatment plan of patients who have communication and swallowing disorders. I introduce a variety of communication aids and help train patients, families and other healthcare staff in how to use them. As a senior member of the team, I also lead the coordination of care for the frailest patients. I am a relatively new line manager and provide clinical support and advice to the junior therapists and manage their workloads. I feel confident in my clinical role, but I am finding line management challenging. I would like to develop my management and leadership skills so I can support the team more effectively.

### Framework Application

I had a discussion with my line manager about wanting to improve my management and leadership skills. We used the framework to talk through some of the specific challenges I'm having in managing the team and I started to understand that the difficulty I was having with managing staff performance could be helped by developing my communication skills. So we have agreed for me to complete a module on managing difficult conversations. I feel positive about having a shared understanding with my line manager about the challenges I'm facing and what support I need to address them.

## Persona 6: Midwife

### Role Context

I am a midwife. I work autonomously around all aspects of pregnancy and childbirth. I assess, implement and evaluate the maternity care for my patients. I am a resource for other members of our multidisciplinary team for more complex patients. I also deputise for more senior members of the team when necessary. I currently work between a maternity ward and clinic in a hospital and work a shift pattern. I enjoy my current role, particularly working in the multidisciplinary team, where I am learning more about listening to patients needs and feedback. I would like to continue to build impactful relationships within the team as well as with other teams and health care workers as I continue to gain experience in improving care.

### Framework Application

Building impactful relationships and listening to patient experiences are both part of the framework. I am seeking ways to improve in these areas in my current role, for example through mentoring or coaching. I'm having discussions with my line manager so that I ensure I have dedicated time for these activities.

## Persona 7: Community Pharmacist

### Role Context

As a pharmacist based in the community and closely linked to a GP practice, I manage medication plans, medication reviews, and help patients with chronic conditions optimise their treatment plans. I strive to help our linked GP practice by being the first port of call for handling medication related queries, repeat prescriptions and clinical audits. I have been in my role for several years now and would like to progress to a lead pharmacist position when the opportunity arises. To do this, I would like to understand what leadership skills I should be working towards. I have a physical disability which means at times I find it difficult to access learning and development opportunities. I prefer learning with other people, but I need to make sure my personal needs are catered for.

### Framework Application

The management and leadership framework is useful as it helps me understand what it takes to reach the next step in my career path. I have found and enrolled on learning and development courses so that I fulfil these requirements. I am using the framework to help me request accessible training to accommodate my specific needs. As a result, the team that I manage in future will be well supported and be productive in helping alleviate pressures on GP surgeries.

## Persona 8: Ward Nurse

### Role Context

I am a ward nurse. I assess and monitor patient conditions, check symptoms and vital signs and arrange diagnostic tests. My role requires that I can make the right decisions in changing clinical situations. I have built excellent relationships working with other nurses on the ward as well as with colleagues from other disciplines. I am keen to take the next step in my career and one day would like to become a ward matron. I really enjoy supporting patients and families as they navigate the admission process. One of the perks of being a ward nurse is that I get to know patients in a different way to other healthcare professionals as they are under my care all the time. I am often the one who will raise the alarm if they deteriorate. Working closely with other disciplines means I deal with competing priorities and different ideas of what an emergency might be or mean.

### Framework Application

The management and leadership framework has helped me identify a learning need against a stage 2 competency around how to approach 'managing upwards.' This will put me in a good position when I apply for more senior jobs. I have discussed this with some of my nursing colleagues, and management are supporting us to access a training opportunity around effective interdisciplinary communication. This will help me effectively communicate priorities to colleagues who aren't ward based.

  - Bullying from some UK staff about "taking jobs"
- **Power Position:** Low organisational power despite professional qualification. Migrant status and visa dependency create vulnerability. Band 5 nurse has some professional autonomy but racialised position limits influence. Seen as "cheap labour".

## Persona 9: Estates Manager

### Role Context

As an estates manager, I work with and support the estates helpdesk. I plan, manage and deliver estates projects. I work alongside staff in all areas, including contractors, suppliers, specialist consultants and patients. My workload is full of time sensitive tasks. I enjoy the variety and the fast-paced nature of my job but sometimes I feel frustrated when prioritisation seems like an impossible task with so many important demands.

### Framework Application

The management and leadership framework got me thinking around how I would like to improve my use of data to inform my decisions. I want to use evidence to challenge my own practice and help identify new ways of working to improve the service. I am hoping that this might help alleviate some of the feelings of frustration around competing demands. I have had discussions around this with my line manager, using the framework as a guide. One appraisal objective this year is to complete some learning and development which will strengthen my use of data and work on a project where I can use these skills. My line manager is supportive, and we have already been looking at learning and development and projects which help me achieve these goals.

### Diversity Profile

#### Protected Characteristics
- **Identity:** White British man, age 42, gay (out at work), deaf/hard of hearing
- **Relevant Context:** Working class background, vocational qualifications route (not university). Partner is Black British man. Out at work but aware of heteronormative assumptions. Grammar school to apprenticeship path. Progressive hearing loss over past 10 years (started age 32), now severe-to-profound. Uses hearing aids and lip-reading. Learning BSL, comfortable identifying as deaf (lowercase d - not Deaf culturally but audiologically deaf).

#### Positionality
- **Social Class:** Working class background, skilled trades family, now professional middle class through career
- **Educational Background:** Grammar school, apprenticeship, HNC, professional qualifications, no degree
- **Family Context:** Partnered (civil partnership), no children, own home, middle class lifestyle now
- **Geographic Context:** Commuter belt, travels to hospital site daily
- **Religious Identity:** Not religious
- **Disability Experience:** Acquired progressive hearing loss (sensorineural) from occupational noise exposure in earlier roles. Initially denied hearing loss ("not that bad"), delayed seeking help due to stigma. Hearing aids help but don't restore normal hearing. Lip-reading essential for face-to-face communication. Phone calls extremely difficult. Background noise (construction sites, plant rooms) makes hearing aids less effective. Learning BSL to prepare for further deterioration. Partner learning BSL too. Noisy hospital environment creates constant communication challenges.

#### Experience of Power
- **Minoritised Identities:** Gay man in male-dominated estates/facilities profession, deaf/hard of hearing, acquired disability
- **Experienced Barriers:**
  - Homophobic "banter" in estates teams (less than before but persists)
  - Heteronormative assumptions about family and relationships
  - Exclusion from some social activities (football, pub culture)
  - Technical/vocational route seen as less than graduate management route
  - Estates undervalued compared to clinical and corporate functions
  - Limited career progression without moving to corporate roles
  - Meetings without captioning or lip-reading considerations
  - Phone-based communication culture excludes him
  - Colleagues forget to face him when speaking
  - Background noise in plant rooms and construction sites makes hearing impossible
  - Video calls often don't have captions
  - Fire alarms visual but not all alerts are
  - Assumptions that hearing aids "fix" deafness
  - Resistance to BSL interpreter costs
  - Being asked to "just try harder to hear"

  - Class-based assumptions about capability for strategic thinking
  - Being shouted at when doesn't hear (treated as incompetent not deaf)
  - Excluded from informal conversations and social banter
  - Missing important information shared verbally
  - Assumptions that deaf people can't do safety-critical work
  - Being overlooked for promotion due to "communication difficulties"
  - Ableist language ("falling on deaf ears", "turn a deaf ear")
- **Power Position:** Moderate power as manager but estates function undervalued in NHS hierarchy. Gay identity reduces power in masculine technical culture. Deaf/hard of hearing creates significant communication barriers and marginalisation. White privilege, male privilege, middle-class position provide advantages. Working class background creates different relationship to management. Acquired disability means not part of Deaf community but also not fully "hearing world".

#### Critical Consciousness
- **Awareness of Structural Inequality:** Understands homophobia and heteronormativity. Aware of class barriers to progression. Recognises estates staff undervalued despite critical role. Increasingly aware of audism (discrimination against deaf people) and how built environment and communication culture disable. Understands intersections of class, sexuality, educational background, disability. Recognises hearing privilege existed before.
- **Experience Challenging Power:** Challenges homophobic language directly (has authority now to do so). Advocates for estates staff recognition and development. Mentors apprentices and those from technical backgrounds. Visible about civil partnership. Advocates for deaf access (captions, BSL, visual alerts). Challenges phone-centric communication. Requests adjustments for meetings. Educates colleagues about hearing loss and communication access.
- **Recognition of Privilege:** White, male, cisgender, financially secure, homeowner, professional middle class position. Partner also in stable employment. Grammar school education gave opportunities not available to all working class peers. Hearing privilege for first 32 years of life. Acquired hearing loss as adult means already established career (harder for those deaf from birth/childhood).
- **Commitment to Justice:** Committed to inclusive workplace for LGBTQ+ staff. Wants estates profession recognised and valued. Supports vocational and apprenticeship routes. Advocates for working class staff progression. Committed to deaf access and communication rights.
