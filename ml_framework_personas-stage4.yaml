  documentPurpose: >
    This extended persona document supports gap-analysis testing of learning modules
    across all competency levels. Each persona now includes diversity profiles reflecting
    WRES/WDES workforce data, learning readiness profiles, and specific evaluation
    criteria to test whether modules genuinely address power, difference, inclusion,
    and transformational learning as specified in the design guidelines.
  
  stages:
  - stageName: 'Stage 4: Executive managers and leaders'
    description: >
      This stage supports individuals operating and accountable at the most
      senior level of their organisation, including executive directors, non-executive
      directors and board members. The competencies enable these leaders to
      set or oversee strategic direction and vision, shape organisational
      culture, and collaborate with peers and stakeholders to deliver national
      and ministerial priorities.

      role: Programme Director for Quality and Governance
      context: >
        As the programme director for quality and governance in adult clinical
        services, I ensure that the service division is managed safely, effectively
        and in accordance with our strategic and operational objectives. I
        provide support and advice on all aspects of service provision. This
        includes promoting a multidisciplinary team approach, representing
        patient need at executive level and embedding clinical leadership
        in services. I provide operational leadership around governance, patient
        safety, and quality improvement.
      
      frameworkApplication: >
        The management and leadership framework is helping me identify a possible
        area of further development in how to approach the long-term sustainability
        of my work. I work in such a fast-paced environment that I don't always
        get the opportunity to understand the long-term impact. I have set
        myself a goal to connect with people in similar roles and learn from
        others across the healthcare system, to address this need.

            Mental health disability (depression), recovered from addiction,
            working-class origin in professional role
          experiencedBarriers:
            - Mental health crisis almost ended career - stigma about 'weakness' in ambulance culture
            - Addiction recovery meant navigating workplace alcohol culture carefully
            - Working-class accent and background created early career barriers
            - Non-traditional educational route meant proving credibility repeatedly
            - Depression management requires flexibility (sometimes needs reduced hours)
            - Divorce during crisis period created financial and emotional instability
          experiencedDiscrimination:
            - Mental health disclosure met with reduced responsibilities ('not up to it')
            - Gossip and speculation during addiction recovery ('unreliable', 'damaged')
            - Class-based assumptions about intelligence and leadership capability
            - Patronising comments about 'impressive' achievement given background
            - Pressure to socialise in alcohol-centred environments despite recovery
          powerPosition: >
            High organisational power as director reporting to CEO. White, male,
            professional status provide structural advantages. However, mental
            health disability creates vulnerability (stigma, disclosure decisions,
            reasonable adjustments needs). Working-class origin sometimes surfaces
            in cultural mismatch with middle-class professional norms. Recovery
            from addiction requires ongoing management (AA meetings, sobriety) -
            this isn't just 'past' but present reality. Uses positional power to
            challenge stigma and advocate for staff wellbeing.

            Understands structural disadvantage from working-class background.
            Recognises how mental health stigma operates in organisations (seen
            as individual failing not systemic issue). Knows addiction has class
            dimensions (middle-class drinking normalised, working-class addiction
            pathologised). Aware of how ambulance culture values stoicism over
            vulnerability. Understands intersections of class, mental health, and
            masculinity in shaping workplace experiences.

            Champions trauma-informed approaches to workforce wellbeing. Challenges
            drinking culture in professional settings. Uses lived experience
            strategically to shift organisational culture. Mentors staff experiencing
            mental health difficulties. Pushes for reasonable adjustments to be
            normalised not exceptional. Challenges board when policies would harm
            vulnerable staff.

            position, financial security now, cisgender. Recovery gives insight
            but also three years sobriety means stability many in active addiction
            don't have.

            have responsibility not to damage staff mental health. Wants to challenge

            Champions trauma-informed approaches. Believes leadership should model
            vulnerability and humanity not invincibility.

            Openly shares recovery story when serves purpose (modelling, reducing
            stigma, creating safety for others). Strategic about context and audience.
            More guarded in some political contexts. Recovery teaches radical
            honesty balanced with appropriate boundaries.
