  applicationGuidance:
    forModuleDesigners: >
      Use these questions during module design to test whether content genuinely
      addresses power, inclusion, and transformational learning. Select questions
      most relevant to the specific competency and stage. Ensure at least one
      question from each cross-cutting theme is considered.
    
    forModuleReviewers: >
      Use these questions to evaluate draft modules. Look for evidence that the
      module addresses the questions, not just mentions diversity. Check whether
      examples, activities, and prompts genuinely engage with power and difference
      rather than treating them as add-ons.
    
    forModulePilotTesters: >
      Use personas and their evaluation questions to test modules from diverse
      perspectives. Ask: "If I were [persona], would this module work for me?
      Would it address my specific barriers? Would it help me develop this competency
      in my context?"
    
    forQualityAssurance: >
      Use cross-cutting themes as quality standards. All modules should address
      Principle 10, provide transformational inquiry, be accessible, support
      contextualisation, guide evidence gathering, match level, integrate I-We-It,
      and acknowledge limitations.
    
    iterativeDevelopment: >
      These questions should be used throughout iterative design cycles, not as
      one-time checklist. Return to them repeatedly as modules develop. Use them
      to identify gaps, refine content, and ensure genuine inclusion rather than
      superficial diversity references.
