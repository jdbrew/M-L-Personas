  frameworkElementName: Personas by stage of the Management and Leadership Framework (Gap-Analysis Edition)
  documentPurpose: >
    This extended persona document supports gap-analysis testing of learning modules
    across all competency levels. Each persona now includes diversity profiles reflecting
    WRES/WDES workforce data, learning readiness profiles, and specific evaluation
    criteria to test whether modules genuinely address power, difference, inclusion,
    and transformational learning as specified in the design guidelines.
  
  stages:
  - stageName: 'Stage 2: Middle managers and leaders'
    description: >
      This stage supports managers and leaders with responsibility for multiple
      teams, functions, services, or sites. These individuals lead other managers
      and are accountable for outcomes across their area of responsibility. They
      translate organisational strategy into operational delivery and build
      capability across teams.

      role: Strategic Commissioning Manager
      context: >
        I work as a strategic commissioning manager in an integrated care board.
        A lot of my work is around overseeing and managing healthcare contracts.
        I support the team in negotiating, developing and documenting contracts.
        I like the fact that there is such a variety of different tasks that
        go into contract management. I have worked in this role for around 7
        years and in other roles in the NHS for many more years. I currently
        work full time, but I am considering what the next steps are for me
        around reducing my hours and retirement.
      
      frameworkApplication: >
        I would really like to be upskilled in how I can demonstrate value
        for money. The management and leadership framework is helping me make
        a case to refresh my knowledge. I am exploring mentoring opportunities
        to achieve this. This will benefit me, but it will also help me give
        assurance to colleagues and the taxpayer that money is being spent
        responsibly. As a manager, I have also worked to create development
        plans for my team and have used the Framework as a starting point for
        these conversations.

          powerPosition: >
            Moderate formal authority in commissioning role. White, male, heterosexual,

        I am a HR manager. I manage a small specialist HR team to make sure
        that HR issues are fully considered and managed before, during and
        after they arise, and that we are compliant with employment law. I
        specifically provide HR advice around organisational change, and I
        do everything I can to deliver comprehensive and proactive operational
        HR support. I am new to the NHS and work a four-day week on condensed
        hours which helps with my childcare commitments. However, getting time
        away from work for learning and development is difficult as my days
        are jam packed. I prefer learning online in small, bite-sized chunks
        that I can fit around my busy schedule.

        I can be as supportive as possible and remain knowledgeable and compassionate.
        I am attending online learning about the framework as well as watching
        recorded sessions on the different areas it covers. This helps me fully
        understand the framework and the areas it relates to. It will also
        help me support my team and other colleagues in using the framework.

        standards. We are also responsible for communication around repairs

        learning and being assessed on my practical surgical skills but would

        They started discussions with the service manager as this isn't a clinical
        skill but is still one that impacts the service and my personal development.
        I have since been able to identify how to get feedback on my management
        and leadership approach. This has helped me identify different ways
        of supporting junior colleagues in different situations. I now feel
        more comfortable supporting them and it has opened the channels of

      role: Lead Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner
      context: >
        As a lead psychological wellbeing practitioner I provide clinical leadership
        and nurture the professional growth of my psychological wellbeing practitioner
        team. We improve access to mental health support by providing low intensity
        clinical interventions to our patients. I lead on delivery by supporting
        my team to provide services that suit patient need and preference (remote,
        face to face, group therapy). I also ensure timely access to support
        for patients. My team are geographically dispersed, and I work flexibly
        across a range of sites travelling between them to ensure hands on
        leadership. Our services are in high demand. My team deal with the
        mental health of our patients every day with increasing workloads but
        there is more that we can do to support their personal wellbeing.
      
      frameworkApplication: >
        The framework includes safety and wellbeing so I included this element
        of the framework when I raised my concerns with our service management
        team. The framework helped me show that this is a priority area for
        the whole NHS. Since then, we have been working on new pathways for
        specialist support for staff should they need it. I am hoping that
        if this is successful in my team then other psychological wellbeing
        practitioner teams might also choose to implement something similar.

              Working class background. Trans man (transitioned age 21 during university).
              Came to psychology through own mental health recovery, partly linked to
              gender dysphoria journey. Out at work as both trans and gay. Partner is
              cisgender man. Experience of mental health system as service user and
              trans person informs professional practice.

            Socially transitioned at 21, medically transitioned over several years.
            Mental health system experiences include both supportive and harmful
            interactions. Gender dysphoria diagnosis and treatment navigation taught
            resilience. Partner met post-transition. "Passing privilege" as binary
            trans man means often assumed cisgender unless disclosed.

            Trans man, gay, working class background, mental health service user, PWP
            (less powerful than clinical psychologist)
          experiencedBarriers:
            - PWP role less valued than clinical psychology despite high demand
            - Mental health lived experience can be stigmatised professionally
            - Working class background creates subtle marginalisation in professional spaces
            - Geographic dispersion makes team leadership challenging
            - Gay identity means some patients refuse care or make complaints
            - Limited career progression pathways for PWPs
            - Trans identity means constant vigilance about disclosure and safety
            - Fear of using toilets/changing facilities in some sites
            - Patients refusing care when trans identity disclosed
            - Microaggressions and invasive questions about body/transition
            - Mental health expertise questioned due to trans status
            - Assumed to only work with LGBTQ+ patients
          experiencedDiscrimination:
            - Transphobic comments and misgendering from patients and some staff
            - Homophobic comments from some patients
            - Trans experience conflated with mental illness (pathologising)
            - Mental health stigma when discloses lived experience
            - Class-based assumptions about intellect
            - PWP role dismissed as "not real psychology"
            - '"Too sensitive" comments about advocating for staff wellbeing'
            - Being asked about "born name" and invasive questions about body
          powerPosition: >
            Moderate formal authority as team lead. Trans, gay, working class, mental
            health service user creates multiple marginalisation. White privilege,
            male privilege (with caveats as trans man), professional status provide
            advantages. "Passing privilege" reduces some discrimination but doesn't
            eliminate vulnerability. PWP role structurally less powerful than clinical
            psychology.

            class barriers to accessing mental health support and entering profession.
            Sees how staff wellbeing is treated as individual responsibility not
            organisational duty. Aware of how binary gender assumptions exclude
            non-binary people.
