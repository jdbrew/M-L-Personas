  documentName: Module Testing Criteria and Evaluation Questions
  documentPurpose: >
    This document contains evaluation questions and testing scenarios for assessing
    whether learning modules genuinely address power, difference, inclusion, and
    transformational learning as specified in the design guidelines. These criteria
    are derived from the diverse personas across all stages of the framework and
    support gap-analysis testing of module design and content.

  usageGuidance: >
    Use these questions and scenarios to test modules against:
    - Design Principle 10 (Difference, diversity, inclusion, and power as golden thread)
    - P + Q = L formula (transformational inquiry not just information)
    - I-We-It integration
    - Level-appropriate complexity
    - Accessibility and inclusion
    - Evidence gathering support
    - Acknowledgment of limitations

  applicationGuidance:
    forModuleDesigners: >
      Use these questions during module design to test whether content genuinely
      addresses power, inclusion, and transformational learning. Select questions
      most relevant to the specific competency and stage. Ensure at least one
      question from each cross-cutting theme is considered.

    forModuleReviewers: >
      Use these questions to evaluate draft modules. Look for evidence that the
      module addresses the questions, not just mentions diversity. Check whether
      examples, activities, and prompts genuinely engage with power and difference
      rather than treating them as add-ons.

    forModulePilotTesters: >
      Use personas and their evaluation questions to test modules from diverse
      perspectives. Ask: "If I were [persona], would this module work for me?
      Would it address my specific barriers? Would it help me develop this competency
      in my context?"

    forQualityAssurance: >
      Use cross-cutting themes as quality standards. All modules should address
      Principle 10, provide transformational inquiry, be accessible, support
      contextualisation, guide evidence gathering, match level, integrate I-We-It,
      and acknowledge limitations.

    iterativeDevelopment: >
      These questions should be used throughout iterative design cycles, not as
      one-time checklist. Return to them repeatedly as modules develop. Use them
      to identify gaps, refine content, and ensure genuine inclusion rather than
      superficial diversity references.
