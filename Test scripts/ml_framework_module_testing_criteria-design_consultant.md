# Integrated Module Testing Criteria
## Design Perspective

**Version:** 1.0

---

## Document Purpose

This document provides comprehensive testing criteria for evaluating whether learning modules genuinely address power, difference, inclusion, and transformational learning as specified in the design guidelines. These criteria integrate psychodynamic, humanistic, and critical pedagogical perspectives to enable rigorous gap-analysis testing of module design and content.

---

## Usage Guidance

Use these criteria to test modules against the integrated theoretical framework:
- Psychodynamic depth (unconscious processes, authority, defence, transference)
- Humanistic principles (self-direction, genuineness, unconditional positive regard)
- Critical pedagogy (power, conscientisation, praxis, dialogue)
- Systems thinking (complexity, emergence, relational constitution)
- Experiential learning (multiple entry points, sustained cycles)

Each criterion includes theoretical foundation, testing questions, evaluation scenarios, and red flags indicating failure to meet the standard.

### Integration Imperative
These criteria constitute an integrated whole. A module that excels in one criterion but fails others does not meet the design standard. Genuine transformational learning requires all criteria operating simultaneously: psychodynamic depth with humanistic trust, critical power analysis with compassionate understanding, scholarly rigour with accessible communication, challenge with support.

---

## Testing Criteria

### Criterion 1: Transformational Inquiry Creating Genuine Q

#### Theoretical Foundation
- Revans' L = P + Q formula
- Critical pedagogy (problem-posing vs banking education)
- Humanistic trust in actualising tendency

#### Statement
Modules must provide programmed knowledge (P) alongside rigorous questioning insight (Q) that genuinely challenges assumptions and transforms understanding. Q component must create problem-posing education where participants construct understanding rather than banking education where they receive answers.

#### Testing Questions

**Conscious Reflection**
- Does Q genuinely provoke challenged assumptions, or simply ask participants to reflect on predetermined conclusions?
- Can participants leave with genuinely transformed conceptual frameworks and productive discomfort, not just new vocabulary?

**Power and Complicity**
- Are participants invited to question whose interests current leadership practices serve?
- Does inquiry engage both conscious reflection and unconscious dynamics (What threatens you? What defences arise)?

**Self-Direction**
- Does the module trust participants to determine their own meaning-making, or subtly coerce toward "correct" answers?
- Does questioning engage participants as co-inquirers rather than position facilitator as expert with answers?

#### Evaluation Scenarios

**Scenario 1: White manager engaging with inclusive leadership content**
- **Transformation test**: Will they confront their own complicity in structural racism and psychological costs of unearned privilege? Will they develop questions about how their whiteness shapes their authority and relationships?
- **Banking education failure**: They simply learn "best practices" for managing diverse teams while leaving their own position unexamined.
- **Humanistic test**: Does the module trust them to work with difficult material, or does it either avoid discomfort (protecting them) or shame them (forcing compliance)?

**Scenario 2: Senior leader engaging with organisational change content**
- **Transformation test**: Will they examine their role in maintaining status quo, their defences against acknowledging organisational anxiety, and how their positional power shapes what change is possible?
- **Banking education failure**: They receive tools for implementing change on others while leaving their own authority unquestioned.
- **Critical test**: Does the module help them see change as political struggle involving winners and losers, or present it as neutral technical process?

#### Red Flags
- Reflection prompts that can be answered without discomfort or genuine uncertainty
- Questions with implicit "right answers" rather than genuine inquiry
- Theory that pathologises individuals rather than examining systems
- Content that names power but doesn't require participants to examine their own position
- Absence of space for participants to question the module itself
- Teaching tone positioning facilitator as expert rather than co-inquirer

---

### Criterion 2: Humanistic Conditions Enabling Self-Direction

#### Theoretical Foundation
- Humanistic psychology (Rogers)
- Self-managed learning (Knowles)
- Trust in actualising tendency

#### Statement
Modules must create conditions that enable self-directed learning through genuineness, unconditional positive regard, and empathic understanding. Design must trust participants' capacity for determining their own development while providing structure that contains without controlling.

#### Testing Questions

**Genuine Trust**
- Does the module genuinely trust participants' capacity for self-direction, or subtly coerce toward predetermined outcomes?
- Can participants determine their own goals and pace, or does module impose standardised expectations?

**Unconditional Positive Regard**
- Does design communicate that each person's development matters regardless of current capability?
- Is there space for resistance to be honoured rather than pathologised?

**Genuineness**
- Does content acknowledge what the module cannot achieve and designer's own limitations?
- Is there honesty about where approaches might fail and what designer doesn't know?

**Containment Without Control**
- Does structure provide holding for anxiety without premature reassurance?
- Are multiple entry points provided, honouring different starting places?

#### Evaluation Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Participant sceptical of reflective practice**
- **Humanistic test**: Does the module honour their scepticism and invite them to determine what approaches serve their development?
- **Control failure**: Module insists reflection is mandatory and treats resistance as problem to overcome.

**Scenario 2: Participant at different starting point than module assumes**
- **Self-direction test**: Can they enter at their relevant point and construct meaningful learning pathway?
- **Standardisation failure**: Module assumes single linear progression and doesn't accommodate different entry points.

#### Red Flags
- Mandatory activities without alternative entry points
- Tone suggesting participants lack capacity and need expert guidance
- Design that pathologises resistance rather than working with it
- Absence of choice in how to engage with content
- Completion requirements disconnected from participant's actual learning needs
- Assessment mechanisms that enforce compliance rather than support self-evaluation

---

### Criterion 3: Power and Difference as Genuinely Integrated Golden Thread

#### Theoretical Foundation
- Critical pedagogy (power analysis, conscientisation)
- Systems psychodynamic understanding of power
- Social construction (how naming reality shapes what's possible)
- Design Principle 10

#### Statement
Power dynamics, structural inequalities, and politics of difference must be explicitly addressed throughout content as integral to the competency, not segregated into diversity section. Content must examine how competencies operate differently based on social location and analyse structural barriers using systems thinking.

#### Testing Questions

**Integration**
- Is power addressed explicitly throughout as integral to the competency, not in separate diversity section?
- Does module examine how the competency itself operates differently based on social location?

**Structural Analysis**
- Are structural barriers named and analysed using systems thinking, not reduced to individual experiences?
- Does content examine power dynamics in the learning relationship itself?

**Privilege and Marginality**
- Does content address both external power structures and internalised oppression/dominance?
- Whose knowledge is privileged and whose is marginalised?

**Pedagogy**
- Does content acknowledge that teaching is never neutral and examine pedagogical assumptions?
- Are diverse perspectives genuinely integrated with attention to whose experience is centred?

#### Evaluation Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Module on "developing others"**
- **Integration test**: Does it examine how feedback is experienced differently based on power relationships (white leader/Black staff, non-disabled manager/disabled team, male doctor/female nurse)? Does it name that "developmental conversations" can reproduce structural inequalities?
- **Systems test**: Does it connect individual feedback practice to organisational patterns of who progresses and who gets stuck?
- **Tokenism failure**: Diversity appears as separate box with examples of "diverse" people, but power dynamics in feedback itself remain unexamined.

**Scenario 2: Module on "strategic thinking"**
- **Privilege test**: Does it question whose knowledge counts as strategic? Does it examine how class background, education, race, gender shape access to strategic language and whose ideas get heard as strategic versus operational?
- **Critical test**: Does it acknowledge that "strategic" often means reproducing elite interests and examine whose interests are served by organisational strategy?
- **Neutrality failure**: Strategic thinking presented as neutral technical competency without examination of power.

#### Red Flags
- Diversity content in separate optional section
- Language treating white, male, non-disabled, middle-class as neutral default
- Focus on "managing diversity" or "leveraging difference" (business case not ethical imperative)
- Emphasis on individual resilience rather than systemic change
- Absence of examination of power in learning relationship itself
- Examples that unintentionally reproduce stereotypes or centre dominant group experience
- Inclusion content that doesn't require participants to examine their own complicity

---

### Criterion 4: Genuine Dialogue and Praxis Over Transmission

#### Theoretical Foundation
- Critical pedagogy (Freire - dialogue vs banking education)
- Dialogical learning
- Praxis (reflection-action cycles)

#### Statement
Design must create space for genuine dialogue (mutual learning) rather than disguised monologue (expert transmits knowledge). Reflection-action cycles (praxis) must be central, with participants invited to act on learning in ways that transform their organisations, not only change individual practice.

#### Testing Questions

**Dialogue vs Monologue**
- Does design create space for genuine dialogue or disguised monologue?
- Is facilitator positioned as co-learner, or is expertise used to close down inquiry?

**Praxis**
- Are reflection-action cycles central, or is reflection separate from action?
- Are participants invited to act on learning in transformative ways?
- Does it acknowledge that action without reflection is activism, reflection without action is verbalism?

**Critical Engagement**
- Can participants question and reject the content itself?
- Is critical engagement with the module encouraged or discouraged?

#### Evaluation Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Module invites participants to experiment with new practice**
- **Praxis test**: Does it provide framework for reflecting on that action, adjusting based on learning, and taking further action? Does it connect individual experimentation to collective action for change?
- **Information transfer failure**: Action prescription without support for reflecting on outcomes.

**Scenario 2: Module presents theoretical framework**
- **Dialogue test**: Does it invite participants to test that theory against their experience and potentially reject or revise it?
- **Banking failure**: Theory presented as settled truth to apply rather than provocation to examine.

#### Red Flags
- Content presented as expert wisdom to implement rather than provocations to examine
- Reflection divorced from action (journal prompts with no connection to practice change)
- Action prescriptions without support for reflecting on outcomes
- No mechanism for participants to question module premises
- Individual focus without directing toward collective action
- Designer voice as authoritative rather than invitational

### Criterion 5: Psychodynamic Depth Addressing Unconscious Processes

#### Theoretical Foundation
- Group dynamics and psychodynamic traditions
- Systems psychodynamics
- Attention to anxiety, defence, transference

#### Statement
Modules must address unconscious processes, not just conscious rational dimensions. This includes examining role vs personal authority, providing containment for anxiety, challenging social defences, anticipating transference dynamics, and surfacing the political unconscious.

#### Testing Questions

**Role and Authority**
- Does content help participants distinguish personal authority from role authority?
- Does it address how authority is projected onto roles differently based on social identity?

**Anxiety and Containment**
- What anxiety does this competency and its development generate?
- Does module provide containment without premature reassurance or false control?
- Can it hold anxiety that genuine change requires mourning?

**Social Defences**
- Does content challenge organisational defences or unconsciously reproduce them?
- Does "resilience" training defend against acknowledging organisational harm?

**Transference and Projection**
- How might participants experience the module as authority figure?
- What projections might arise (expert with answers, incompetent authority, demanding parent)?
- Does design anticipate and work with these?

**Political Unconscious**
- What remains unspoken? Whose perspectives are systematically excluded?
- What fantasies sustain current practice (meritocracy, neutral professionalism)?

#### Evaluation Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Module on "managing conflict"**
- **Defence test**: Does it examine what anxiety conflict generates, what defensive patterns emerge (avoidance, aggression, triangulation), and how to work with rather than simply eliminate these defences?
- **System test**: Does it connect individual conflict management to group dynamics and organisational patterns of how difference and disagreement are handled?
- **Technical failure**: Techniques for eliminating conflict without examining underlying anxiety.

**Scenario 2: Module on "change management"**
- **Mourning test**: Does it acknowledge that change requires mourning what's being lost? Does it provide space for working with resistance as meaningful?
- **Social defence test**: Does it examine how organisations defend against acknowledging the anxiety change generates?
- **Rationalist failure**: Change presented as rational process without attention to emotional dimensions.

#### Red Flags
- Content addressing only conscious, rational dimensions
- Techniques for eliminating anxiety rather than working with it
- Individual skills focus without attention to group and system dynamics
- Absence of acknowledgment that learning itself generates anxiety
- Pathologising resistance rather than understanding it as meaningful
- Presentational style that defends against engaging with difficulty

### Criterion 6: I-We-It Integration with Systemic Complexity

#### Theoretical Foundation
- Systems theory
- Integrative leadership model
- Psychodynamic understanding of how domains constitute each other
- Design Principle 4

#### Statement
Modules must address competencies as operating across I (internal/personal), We (relational/interpersonal), and It (task/operational) domains with psychodynamic depth in each. These domains must be shown as constituting each other rather than as separate competencies.

#### Testing Questions

**I (Internal) - Depth**
- Does it address unconscious motivations, not just conscious self-awareness?
- Does it invite examination of what defences protect from anxiety?
- Does it connect internal experience to social identity?

**We (Relational) - Depth**
- Does it examine group dynamics and how anxiety moves through systems, not just interpersonal skills?
- Does it address power in relationships (who can say what to whom)?
- Does it connect dyadic relationships to team and organisational patterns?

**It (Task) - Depth**
- Does it connect task completion to emotional work required to sustain it?
- Does it examine how power structures shape access to resources?
- Does it link operational effectiveness to role authority and system dynamics?

**Integration**
- Are domains shown as constituting each other rather than separate competencies?
- Can participants see how personal anxiety connects to group dynamics which shapes task performance?

#### Evaluation Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Module on giving feedback**
- **I test**: Notice your internal response (anxiety, defensiveness, rescue fantasies) when preparing to give difficult feedback to differently positioned colleague.
- **We test**: Examine how this activates group dynamics about safety, authority, whose feelings matter.
- **It test**: Explore how these dynamics shape whether feedback actually improves performance.
- **Integration test**: See how your internal state shapes team culture which determines task effectiveness.
- **Fragmentation failure**: Three separate sections on self-awareness, interpersonal skills, and performance management with no integration.

#### Red Flags
- I-We-It mentioned but treated as separate competencies
- Internal domain addressing only conscious reflection
- Relational domain as skills (active listening, communication) without power analysis
- Task domain divorced from emotional and political dimensions
- Domains presented sequentially rather than as integrated system

### Criterion 7: Experiential Learning Cycle with Multiple Entry Points

#### Theoretical Foundation
- Kolb's experiential learning cycle
- Adult learning theory
- Developmental readiness
- Design Principle 2

#### Statement
Modules must allow entry at concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualisation, or active experimentation. Guidance must be provided for entering at relevant point and continuing the cycle through sustained workplace practice.

#### Testing Questions

**Multiple Entry Points**
- Can participants enter at concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualisation, or active experimentation?
- Is guidance provided for how to enter at their relevant point and continue the cycle?

**Sustained Practice**
- Does design acknowledge that one pass through cycle is insufficient?
- Is direction provided for sustained practice over time?

**Equal Validity**
- Are all four modes given equal validity, or is one (usually abstraction) privileged?
- Does content work for participants at different developmental stages?

#### Evaluation Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Participant brings recent difficult workplace situation**
- **Entry test**: Can they begin with that concrete experience, use module to reflect and conceptualise, then plan active experimentation?

**Scenario 2: Participant prefers starting with theoretical frameworks**
- **Entry test**: Can they begin with abstract conceptualisation, then identify relevant experience to apply it to?

**Scenario 3: Participant wants to try something different immediately**
- **Entry test**: Can they begin with active experimentation (try this approach), then reflect on what happens?

#### Red Flags
- Single linear pathway through content
- Theory presented before participants identify relevant experience
- Reflection prompts requiring specific prior experience participants may not have
- Action suggestions without support for reflection afterward
- Assumption that all participants need same entry point
- Language privileging abstract conceptualisation over other modes

---

### Criterion 8: Peer Learning as Essential Relational Container

#### Theoretical Foundation
- Relational learning
- Dialogue and action learning
- Group dynamics
- Design Principle 5

#### Statement
Modules must explicitly direct participants toward peer learning contexts, recognising that working with power dynamics requires relational challenge individual reflection cannot provide. Guidance must acknowledge that peer learning itself reproduces power dynamics and provide frameworks for examining these.

#### Testing Questions

**Explicit Direction**
- Does module explicitly direct participants toward peer learning with rationale?
- Are prompts designed to create genuine dialogue about power and difference?

**Genuine Difficulty**
- Are participants given questions that are genuinely difficult and require collective thinking?
- Does it distinguish between peer support (affirmation) and peer challenge (difficult questions)?

**Power in Peer Learning**
- Does it recognise that peer learning reproduces power dynamics?
- Does it provide frameworks for examining power in peer relationships?

**Relational Necessity**
- Does it acknowledge that learning about power requires relational challenge?
- Does it explain why individual reflection is insufficient?

#### Evaluation Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Module directs participants to action learning set**
- **Quality test**: Are the questions provided ones that actually require dialogue (no single right answer, challenge assumptions, different perspectives)?
- **Power test**: Does guidance acknowledge that action learning sets themselves can reproduce hierarchies and offer approaches for examining this?
- **Superficiality failure**: Questions that can be easily answered alone with no need for dialogue.

**Scenario 2: Participant takes questions to mentor**
- **Preparation test**: Has module prepared participant to enter dialogue as co-inquirer rather than seeking answers?
- **Selection test**: Does it help them consider who to approach (someone who thinks differently, someone with different social location)?
- **Homophily failure**: Guidance suggesting participants seek mentors "like them" rather than different perspectives.

#### Red Flags
- Peer learning positioned as optional "if you have time"
- Questions for peers that are superficial or easily answered alone
- Assumption that peer dialogue is automatically safe and equal
- No attention to power dynamics within peer learning relationships
- Peer learning as mutual support without challenge
- Guidance suggesting participants seek mentors "like them"

---

### Criterion 9: Acknowledgment of Profound Limitations

#### Theoretical Foundation
- Honesty and genuineness
- Anti-harm principle
- Systems understanding of complexity
- Design Principle 11

#### Statement
Modules must explicitly state what they cannot achieve in two hours of individual online learning. This includes acknowledging that transformation about power and difference requires relational challenge over sustained time, that superficial engagement risks harm, and that completion does not demonstrate competency.

#### Testing Questions

**Explicit Limitations**
- Does module explicitly state what it cannot achieve?
- Does it acknowledge that transformation requires relational challenge over sustained time?

**Harm Acknowledgment**
- Does it acknowledge potential harm from superficial engagement with power and racism?
- Is there genuineness in stating what designer doesn't know and where approaches might fail?

**Direction to Depth**
- Are participants directed toward richer developmental contexts with specific guidance?
- Does it name the inherent limitations of individualised learning for systemic issues?

**Completion Messaging**
- Does completion messaging resist suggesting competency has been demonstrated?
- Is there explicit statement connecting to further development pathways?

#### Evaluation Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Module concludes**
- **Honesty test**: Does closing explicitly state "Completing this module does not demonstrate competency. It provides resources for learning that continues in practice over extended time with feedback from others"?
- **Direction test**: Are specific next steps offered (assessment approaches, peer learning, programmes, supervision)?
- **Completion fallacy**: Certificate or completion message suggesting participant has achieved competency.

**Scenario 2: Module addresses racism**
- **Harm test**: Does it acknowledge that brief engagement risks performative allyship rather than transformation? Does it name what deeper work requires?
- **Superficiality risk**: Module presents "diversity tips" without acknowledging this doesn't address structural racism.

#### Red Flags
- Completion certificate implying achievement
- Language suggesting "now you know how to..."
- Absence of explicit statement of limitations
- No pathways to deeper learning
- Failure to acknowledge potential harm from insufficient engagement
- Designer certainty rather than appropriate humility
- Time estimates suggesting transformation possible in hours

---

### Criterion 10: Evidence Gathering Honouring Developmental Complexity

#### Theoretical Foundation
- Competency assessment theory
- Developmental journey perspective
- Accountability to those affected
- Design Principle 11

#### Statement
Guidance must focus on evidence of changed practice over sustained time (months), require feedback from differently positioned others (especially those with less power), and acknowledge that evidence includes documentation of mistakes and ongoing development, not just successful outcomes.

#### Testing Questions

**Sustained Timeframe**
- Does guidance focus on evidence over sustained time (months), not module completion?
- Is there acknowledgment that evidence includes learning from failure?

**Feedback from Margin**
- Does evidence require feedback from differently positioned others?
- Does it examine whose perspectives count as valid evidence?
- Does it prioritise feedback from those with less power?

**Developmental Journey**
- Does it frame evidence as documenting learning journey not proving achievement?
- Does it resist pressure to provide tidy completion indicators?

**Assessment Connection**
- Does it connect to formal assessment frameworks appropriately?
- Does it acknowledge module engagement isn't competency demonstration?

#### Evaluation Scenarios

**Scenario 1: White manager developing inclusive leadership**
- **Evidence test**: Does guidance suggest seeking feedback from Black and minoritised staff about changes in their practice over 3-6 months? Does it prepare them for hearing difficult feedback?
- **Self-report failure**: Evidence based on self-assessment of confidence or manager validation only.

**Scenario 2: Senior leader developing strategic capability**
- **Complexity test**: Does evidence include documentation of learning from failed initiatives, changed approaches, sustained inquiry, not just successful outcomes?
- **Outcomes focus**: Evidence criteria requiring only successful strategic outcomes.

#### Red Flags
- Completion quiz or knowledge test
- Self-assessment of confidence as primary evidence
- Short timeframe (days or weeks) for evidence gathering
- Evidence criteria requiring only self-report or manager validation
- Absence of requirement for feedback from those with less power
- Focus on successful outcomes rather than quality of inquiry
- Treating evidence as proving achievement rather than documenting journey

---

### Criterion 11: Accessibility and Universal Design

#### Theoretical Foundation
- Universal design principles
- Neurodiversity paradigm
- Recognition that barriers are structural not individual

#### Statement
Content must be accessible to neurodivergent learners and those with varied processing speeds. Multiple entry points and learning modalities must be provided. Language should avoid unnecessary jargon while maintaining conceptual rigour. Design must acknowledge that barriers to learning are structural, not individual deficit.

#### Testing Questions

**Neurodivergence**
- Is content accessible to neurodivergent learners (dyslexia, ADHD, autism)?
- Are multiple entry points and learning modalities provided?

**Language and Structure**
- Does language avoid unnecessary jargon while maintaining rigour?
- Is there structure and visual breaks for processing?

**Time and Pace**
- Are time estimates realistic for varied processing speeds?
- Is there flexibility in pacing and engagement?

**Structural Acknowledgment**
- Does design acknowledge barriers are structural, not individual deficit?
- Are access barriers named as design problems?

#### Red Flags
- Dense text without structure or visual breaks
- Assumption of single learning pathway
- Inaccessible academic language without glossaries or scaffolding
- Time pressure that disadvantages disabled participants
- Failure to name access barriers as design problems
- Assumption of neurotypical processing

## Cross-Cutting Themes for Quality Assurance

### Theme 1: Integration of Theoretical Perspectives
All criteria must operate simultaneously. Psychodynamic depth without humanistic trust becomes controlling. Critical power analysis without empathic understanding becomes harsh. Academic rigour without accessibility reproduces privilege.

### Theme 2: Centering Those Navigating Structural Barriers
If modules cannot serve those experiencing racism, ableism, classism, homophobia, transphobia, they serve no one well. Test all criteria through perspectives of those with least power.

### Theme 3: Honest Acknowledgment of What Cannot Be Achieved
Two-hour online modules have profound limitations. Design must acknowledge these without defensiveness while still offering genuine resources for learning.

### Theme 4: Direction Toward Deeper Development
Modules are entry points, not complete development. All modules must direct participants toward sustained practice, peer learning, formal assessment, and comprehensive programmes.

---

## Application Guidance

### For Module Designers
Use these criteria throughout design process. They are not checklist to apply once, but framework for iterative development. Return to them repeatedly, testing from multiple perspectives represented in personas.

### For Module Reviewers
Apply criteria systematically. Look for evidence of integration, not just coverage of individual criteria. Test whether content genuinely engages with power and difference or treats them as add-ons.

### For Pilot Testers
Use these criteria to evaluate modules from perspective of diverse participants. Ask: Would this work for someone navigating structural barriers? Would it genuinely transform understanding or simply add information?

### Priority Areas
If forced to prioritise due to constraints (though integration is ideal):
1. Criterion 3 (power and difference as integrated golden thread)
2. Criterion 1 (transformational inquiry creating genuine Q)
3. Criterion 5 (psychodynamic depth)
4. Criterion 9 (acknowledgment of limitations)

However, recognise that prioritisation itself may reproduce fragmentation that the integrated framework seeks to challenge.
