## Stage 4: Executive managers and leaders

### Stage Description

## Persona 23: Programme Director for Quality and Governance

### Role Context

As the programme director for quality and governance in adult clinical services, I ensure that the service division is managed safely, effectively and in accordance with our strategic and operational objectives. I provide support and advice on all aspects of service provision. This includes promoting a multidisciplinary team approach, representing patient need at executive level and embedding clinical leadership in services. I provide operational leadership around governance, patient safety, and quality improvement.

### Framework Application

The management and leadership framework is helping me identify a possible area of further development in how to approach the long-term sustainability of my work. I work in such a fast-paced environment that I don't always get the opportunity to understand the long-term impact. I have set myself a goal to connect with people in similar roles and learn from others across the healthcare system, to address this need.

## Persona 25: Director of Corporate Affairs

### Role Context

I am the director of corporate affairs at a large urban ambulance trust. I report directly into our chief executive, and my job is to ensure that the organisation meets the highest standards of governance, regulatory compliance and public accountability. I have developed the board assurance framework which helps support strategic decision making. I have a specific interest in corporate governance matters that are politically sensitive. I also have oversight of complaints, legal services, patient advice and liaison services (PALS) and patient experience. Through my role, I identify learnings to inform service improvement.

### Framework Application

I have changed some processes for my direct reports and would like to help better support them in navigating challenges, offer useful feedback and ensure that I am a listening collaborator. Balancing safety, productivity and wellbeing is crucial at this level and is clearly described in the framework. As someone who has worked their way up, I want my team to remain grounded in the reality of our colleagues and the daily challenges they face. The framework is helping me approach this topic sensitively and understand the needs of my teams and how best to meet them. Right now, I am setting up reciprocal mentoring opportunities for our leadership team. Which feels like a step in the right direction in cultivating a leadership team that understands the challenges faced by colleagues and who lead in a fair and inclusive way that fosters a culture of open communication trust and belonging for everyone at every level.

### Diversity Profile

#### Protected Characteristics
- **Identity:** White British man, age 47, disabled (mental health - depression, managed), recovered from alcohol dependency
- **Relevant Context:** Experienced depression and alcohol dependency in thirties following traumatic incident in ambulance service. Three years recovery through AA and therapy. Open about mental health at work. Uses lived experience to inform corporate culture and staff wellbeing strategy.

#### Positionality
- **Social Class:** Working class background (father factory worker, mother cleaner). Upward mobility through career. Now professional middle class but retains working-class identity and politics.
- **Educational Background:** Comprehensive school, polytechnic degree (before became university), professional qualifications. Non-traditional route to executive level.
- **Family Context:** Divorced, two adult children (relationships strained during addiction period, now rebuilding). Lives alone. Active in recovery community.
- **Geographic Context:** Urban ambulance trust serving deprived areas. Lives in gentrifying area, aware of displacement dynamics.

#### Experience of Power
- **Minoritised Identities:** Mental health disability (depression), recovered from addiction, working-class origin in professional role
- **Experienced Barriers:**
  - Mental health crisis almost ended career - stigma about 'weakness' in ambulance culture
  - Addiction recovery meant navigating workplace alcohol culture carefully
  - Working-class accent and background created early career barriers
  - Non-traditional educational route meant proving credibility repeatedly
  - Depression management requires flexibility (sometimes needs reduced hours)
  - Divorce during crisis period created financial and emotional instability
- **Experienced Discrimination:**
  - Mental health disclosure met with reduced responsibilities ('not up to it')
  - Gossip and speculation during addiction recovery ('unreliable', 'damaged')
  - Class-based assumptions about intelligence and leadership capability
  - Patronising comments about 'impressive' achievement given background
  - Pressure to socialise in alcohol-centred environments despite recovery
- **Power Position:** High organisational power as director reporting to CEO. White, male, professional status provide structural advantages. However, mental health disability creates vulnerability (stigma, disclosure decisions, reasonable adjustments needs). Working-class origin sometimes surfaces in cultural mismatch with middle-class professional norms. Recovery from addiction requires ongoing management (AA meetings, sobriety) - this isn't just 'past' but present reality. Uses positional power to challenge stigma and advocate for staff wellbeing.

#### Critical Consciousness
- **Awareness of Structural Inequality:** Understands structural disadvantage from working-class background. Recognises how mental health stigma operates in organisations (seen as individual failing not systemic issue). Knows addiction has class dimensions (middle-class drinking normalised, working-class addiction pathologised). Aware of how ambulance culture values stoicism over vulnerability. Understands intersections of class, mental health, and masculinity in shaping workplace experiences.
- **Experience Challenging Power:** Advocates openly for mental health support and anti-stigma culture. Champions trauma-informed approaches to workforce wellbeing. Challenges drinking culture in professional settings. Uses lived experience strategically to shift organisational culture. Mentors staff experiencing mental health difficulties. Pushes for reasonable adjustments to be normalised not exceptional. Challenges board when policies would harm vulnerable staff.
- **Recognition of Privilege:** White, male, heterosexual, able-bodied (no physical disability), British-born, English first language, professional status, executive position, financial security now, cisgender. Recovery gives insight but also three years sobriety means stability many in active addiction don't have.
- **Commitment to Justice:** Committed to creating psychologically safe workplaces. Believes organisations have responsibility not to damage staff mental health. Wants to challenge culture of shame around addiction and mental health. Advocates for working-class staff navigating middle-class professional environments. Champions trauma-informed approaches. Believes leadership should model vulnerability and humanity not invincibility.

- **System Pressures:** Regulatory inspections, board scrutiny, ambulance service pressures (high stress environment), political sensitivity of complaints, workforce mental health crisis, managing own wellbeing amidst organisational trauma

  - Stakeholder management and political navigation
  - Complaints reduction and service improvement
- **Needs Support:**
  - Evidencing personal recovery journey as leadership asset
  - Documenting culture change impact (long-term outcomes)
  - Articulating lived experience credibility without oversharing

#### Potential Misunderstandings
- Thinking mental health history is career liability not asset
- Believing leaders must project invulnerability
- Assuming recovery means being 'fixed' and past no longer relevant
- Thinking disclosure of disability is unprofessional
- Underestimating ongoing management needs (not one-and-done)

### Peer Learning Context

- **Colleague Support:** Some trusted colleagues who know full recovery story. Recovery sponsor essential support. Relationships rebuilding with adult children.

#### Willingness to Engage
- **Comfort:** Very comfortable with reflective practice and peer learning (influenced by recovery work which emphasises vulnerability and mutual support). Values authentic professional relationships over polished performance.
- **Time Commitment:** Protective of time for recovery practices and wellbeing (AA meetings, therapy, exercise). Will commit time for development that genuinely addresses his context.
- **Vulnerability:** Openly shares recovery story when serves purpose (modelling, reducing stigma, creating safety for others). Strategic about context and audience. More guarded in some political contexts. Recovery teaches radical honesty balanced with appropriate boundaries.

### Developmental Trajectory

**Coming From:** Worked way up from working-class background through various non-clinical ambulance trust roles. Navigated mental health crisis and addiction recovery while maintaining career (barely). Built governance expertise and strategic leadership capability. Learned to integrate lived experience as professional asset.

Possible future: Chief Executive role or move to national policy role. Non-executive portfolio focused on staff wellbeing and governance. Want to influence how NHS thinks about mental health in leadership.

**Motivations:**
- Creating workplaces where staff mental health is protected not damaged
- Challenging stigma that nearly ended own career
- Using lived experience to inform organisational culture change
- Role modelling vulnerability and humanity in leadership
- Supporting others navigating mental health and addiction
