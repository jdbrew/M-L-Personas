  frameworkElementName: Personas by stage of the Management and Leadership Framework (Gap-Analysis Edition)
  documentPurpose: >
    This extended persona document supports gap-analysis testing of learning modules
    across all competency levels. Each persona now includes diversity profiles reflecting
    WRES/WDES workforce data, learning readiness profiles, and specific evaluation
    criteria to test whether modules genuinely address power, difference, inclusion,
    and transformational learning as specified in the design guidelines.
  
  stages:
  - stageName: 'Stage 1: New and first-line managers and leaders'
    description: >
      This stage supports individuals in their first supervisory, leadership,
      or management role, typically with responsibility for just one team
      or line of accountability. The competencies help new, and first-line
      managers and leaders understand what is expected of them as they begin
      to take responsibility for the work of others, in addition to their
      own.

      role: Senior Community Speech and Language Therapist
      context: >
        As a senior community speech and language therapist, I mostly manage
        my caseload in the community autonomously. I assess, diagnose and
        manage the treatment plan of patients who have communication and swallowing
        disorders. I introduce a variety of communication aids and help train
        patients, families and other healthcare staff in how to use them.
        As a senior member of the team, I also lead the coordination of care
        for the frailest patients. I am a relatively new line manager and
        provide clinical support and advice to the junior therapists and manage
        their workloads. I feel confident in my clinical role, but I am finding
        line management challenging. I would like to develop my management
        and leadership skills so I can support the team more effectively.
      
      frameworkApplication: >
        I had a discussion with my line manager about wanting to improve my
        management and leadership skills. We used the framework to talk through
        some of the specific challenges I'm having in managing the team and
        I started to understand that the difficulty I was having with managing
        staff performance could be helped by developing my communication
        skills. So we have agreed for me to complete a module on managing difficult
        conversations. I feel positive about having a shared understanding
        with my line manager about the challenges I'm facing and what support
        I need to address them.

        I am a midwife. I work autonomously around all aspects of pregnancy

        for my patients. I am a resource for other members of our multidisciplinary
        team for more complex patients. I also deputise for more senior members
        of the team when necessary. I currently work between a maternity ward
        and clinic in a hospital and work a shift pattern. I enjoy my current
        role, particularly working in the multidisciplinary team, where I am
        learning more about listening to patients needs and feedback. I would
        like to continue to build impactful relationships within the team as

      role: Ward Nurse
      context: >
        I am a ward nurse. I assess and monitor patient conditions, check symptoms
        and vital signs and arrange diagnostic tests. My role requires that
        I can make the right decisions in changing clinical situations. I have
        built excellent relationships working with other nurses on the ward
        as well as with colleagues from other disciplines. I am keen to take
        the next step in my career and one day would like to become a ward
        matron. I really enjoy supporting patients and families as they navigate
        the admission process. One of the perks of being a ward nurse is that
        I get to know patients in a different way to other healthcare professionals
        as they are under my care all the time. I am often the one who will
        raise the alarm if they deteriorate. Working closely with other disciplines
        means I deal with competing priorities and different ideas of what
        an emergency might be or mean.
      
      frameworkApplication: >
        The management and leadership framework has helped me identify a learning
        need against a stage 2 competency around how to approach 'managing
        upwards.' This will put me in a good position when I apply for more
        senior jobs. I have discussed this with some of my nursing colleagues,
        and management are supporting us to access a training opportunity around
        effective interdisciplinary communication. This will help me effectively
        communicate priorities to colleagues who aren't ward based.

        ways of working to improve the service. I am hoping that this might
        help alleviate some of the feelings of frustration around competing
        demands. I have had discussions around this with my line manager, using

        manager is supportive, and we have already been looking at learning
        and development and projects which help me achieve these goals.

            normal hearing. Lip-reading essential for face-to-face communication. Phone
            calls extremely difficult. Background noise (construction sites, plant rooms)
            makes hearing aids less effective. Learning BSL to prepare for further

            privilege, male privilege, middle-class position provide advantages. Working
