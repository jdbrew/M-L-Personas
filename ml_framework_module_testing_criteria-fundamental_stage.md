# Module Testing Criteria and Evaluation Questions
## Fundamental Stage

**Version:** 1.0

---

## Document Purpose

This document contains evaluation questions and testing scenarios for assessing whether learning modules genuinely address power, difference, inclusion, and transformational learning as specified in the design guidelines. These criteria are derived from the diverse personas across all stages of the framework and support gap-analysis testing of module design and content.

## Usage Guidance

Use these questions and scenarios to test modules against:
- Design Principle 10 (Difference, diversity, inclusion, and power as golden thread)
- P + Q = L formula (transformational inquiry not just information)
- I-We-It integration
- Level-appropriate complexity
- Accessibility and inclusion
- Evidence gathering support
- Acknowledgment of limitations

## Cross-Cutting Evaluation Themes

### Theme 1: Principle 10 - Power, Difference, and Inclusion
**Key Questions:**
- Does the module treat diversity as integral to competency, not separate topic?
- Does it surface who has power, whose knowledge is privileged, whose voices are heard?
- Does it address structural inequalities, not just individual behaviour?
- Does it help participants recognise their own positionality and privilege?
- Does it provide frameworks for action, not just awareness?

### Theme 2: Transformational Inquiry (Q component)
**Key Questions:**
- Does the module provoke genuine questioning of assumptions?
- Does it create discomfort that leads to transformed understanding?
- Is there space for critical reflection on power and practice?
- Does it challenge rather than confirm existing thinking?
- Does it move beyond information transfer to transformation?

### Theme 3: Accessibility and Universal Design
**Key Questions:**
- Does the module work for diverse learning needs and access requirements?
- Are examples and language accessible across educational backgrounds?
- Does it assume standard working patterns and availability?
- Can it be accessed flexibly across time zones, shifts, caring responsibilities?
- Does it provide multiple entry points and formats?

### Theme 4: Contextualisation and Application
**Key Questions:**
- Does the module prompt participants to translate to their specific context?
- Does it recognise diverse NHS roles, settings, and contexts?

- Does it avoid generic examples that assume particular contexts?
- Does it help participants navigate their unique situation?

## Application Guidance

### For Module Designers
Use these questions during module design to test whether content genuinely addresses power, inclusion, and transformational learning. Select questions most relevant to the specific competency and stage. Ensure at least one question from each cross-cutting theme is considered.

### For Module Reviewers
Use these questions to evaluate draft modules. Look for evidence that the module addresses the questions, not just mentions diversity. Check whether examples, activities, and prompts genuinely engage with power and difference rather than treating them as add-ons.

### For Module Pilot Testers
Use personas and their evaluation questions to test modules from diverse perspectives. Ask: "If I were [persona], would this module work for me? Would it address my specific barriers? Would it help me develop this competency in my context?"

### For Quality Assurance
Use cross-cutting themes as quality standards. All modules should address Principle 10, provide transformational inquiry, be accessible, support contextualisation, guide evidence gathering, match level, integrate I-We-It, and acknowledge limitations.

### Iterative Development
These questions should be used throughout iterative design cycles, not as one-time checklist. Return to them repeatedly as modules develop. Use them to identify gaps, refine content, and ensure genuine inclusion rather than superficial diversity references.
