  documentName: Integrated Module Testing Criteria - Design Perspective
  documentPurpose: >
    This document provides comprehensive testing criteria for evaluating whether learning
    modules genuinely address power, difference, inclusion, and transformational learning
    as specified in the design guidelines. These criteria integrate psychodynamic,
    humanistic, and critical pedagogical perspectives to enable rigorous gap-analysis
    testing of module design and content.

  usageGuidance: >
    Use these criteria to test modules against the integrated theoretical framework:
    - Psychodynamic depth (unconscious processes, authority, defence, transference)
    - Humanistic principles (self-direction, genuineness, unconditional positive regard)
    - Critical pedagogy (power, conscientisation, praxis, dialogue)
    - Systems thinking (complexity, emergence, relational constitution)
    - Experiential learning (multiple entry points, sustained cycles)
    
    Each criterion includes theoretical foundation, testing questions, evaluation
    scenarios, and red flags indicating failure to meet the standard.

  - criterionId: criterion_1
    title: Transformational Inquiry Creating Genuine Q
    theoreticalFoundation:
      - Revans' L = P + Q formula
      - Critical pedagogy (problem-posing vs banking education)
      - Humanistic trust in actualising tendency
    
    statement: >
      Modules must provide programmed knowledge (P) alongside rigorous questioning insight
      (Q) that genuinely challenges assumptions and transforms understanding. Q component
      must create problem-posing education where participants construct understanding rather
      than banking education where they receive answers.
    
    testingQuestions:
      consciousReflection:
        - Does Q genuinely provoke challenged assumptions, or simply ask participants to reflect on predetermined conclusions?
        - Can participants leave with genuinely transformed conceptual frameworks and productive discomfort, not just new vocabulary?
      
      powerAndComplicity:
        - Are participants invited to question whose interests current leadership practices serve?
        - Does inquiry engage both conscious reflection and unconscious dynamics (What threatens you? What defences arise)?
      
      selfDirection:
        - Does the module trust participants to determine their own meaning-making, or subtly coerce toward "correct" answers?
        - Does questioning engage participants as co-inquirers rather than position facilitator as expert with answers?
    
    evaluationScenarios:
      scenario1:
        context: White manager engaging with inclusive leadership content
        transformationTest: >
          Will they confront their own complicity in structural racism and psychological
          costs of unearned privilege? Will they develop questions about how their whiteness
          shapes their authority and relationships?
        bankingEducationFailure: >
          They simply learn "best practices" for managing diverse teams while leaving their
          own position unexamined.
        humanisticTest: >
          Does the module trust them to work with difficult material, or does it either
          avoid discomfort (protecting them) or shame them (forcing compliance)?
      
      scenario2:
        context: Senior leader engaging with organisational change content
        transformationTest: >
          Will they examine their role in maintaining status quo, their defences against
          acknowledging organisational anxiety, and how their positional power shapes what
          change is possible?
        bankingEducationFailure: >
          They receive tools for implementing change on others while leaving their own
          authority unquestioned.
        criticalTest: >
          Does the module help them see change as political struggle involving winners and
          losers, or present it as neutral technical process?
    
    redFlags:
      - Reflection prompts that can be answered without discomfort or genuine uncertainty
      - Questions with implicit "right answers" rather than genuine inquiry
      - Theory that pathologises individuals rather than examining systems
      - Content that names power but doesn't require participants to examine their own position
      - Absence of space for participants to question the module itself
      - Teaching tone positioning facilitator as expert rather than co-inquirer

  - criterionId: criterion_2
    title: Humanistic Conditions Enabling Self-Direction
    theoreticalFoundation:
      - Humanistic psychology (Rogers)
      - Self-managed learning (Knowles)
      - Trust in actualising tendency
    
    statement: >
      Modules must create conditions that enable self-directed learning through genuineness,
      unconditional positive regard, and empathic understanding. Design must trust
      participants' capacity for determining their own development while providing
      structure that contains without controlling.
    
    testingQuestions:
      genuineTrust:
        - Does the module genuinely trust participants' capacity for self-direction, or subtly coerce toward predetermined outcomes?
        - Can participants determine their own goals and pace, or does module impose standardised expectations?
      
      unconditionaPositiveRegard:
        - Does design communicate that each person's development matters regardless of current capability?
        - Is there space for resistance to be honoured rather than pathologised?
      
      genuineness:
        - Does content acknowledge what the module cannot achieve and designer's own limitations?
        - Is there honesty about where approaches might fail and what designer doesn't know?
      
      containmentWithoutControl:
        - Does structure provide holding for anxiety without premature reassurance?
        - Are multiple entry points provided, honouring different starting places?
    
    evaluationScenarios:
      scenario1:
        context: Participant sceptical of reflective practice
        humanisticTest: >
          Does the module honour their scepticism and invite them to determine what
          approaches serve their development?
        controlFailure: >
          Module insists reflection is mandatory and treats resistance as problem to overcome.
      
      scenario2:
        context: Participant at different starting point than module assumes
        selfDirectionTest: >
          Can they enter at their relevant point and construct meaningful learning pathway?
        standardisationFailure: >
          Module assumes single linear progression and doesn't accommodate different entry points.
    
    redFlags:
      - Mandatory activities without alternative entry points
      - Tone suggesting participants lack capacity and need expert guidance
      - Design that pathologises resistance rather than working with it
      - Absence of choice in how to engage with content
      - Completion requirements disconnected from participant's actual learning needs
      - Assessment mechanisms that enforce compliance rather than support self-evaluation

    title: Power and Difference as Genuinely Integrated Golden Thread
    theoreticalFoundation:
      - Critical pedagogy (power analysis, conscientisation)
      - Systems psychodynamic understanding of power
      - Social construction (how naming reality shapes what's possible)
      - Design Principle 10
    
    statement: >
      Power dynamics, structural inequalities, and politics of difference must be explicitly
      addressed throughout content as integral to the competency, not segregated into
      diversity section. Content must examine how competencies operate differently based on
      social location and analyse structural barriers using systems thinking.
    
    testingQuestions:
      integration:
        - Is power addressed explicitly throughout as integral to the competency, not in separate diversity section?
        - Does module examine how the competency itself operates differently based on social location?
      
      structuralAnalysis:
        - Are structural barriers named and analysed using systems thinking, not reduced to individual experiences?
        - Does content examine power dynamics in the learning relationship itself?
      
      privilegeAndMarginality:
        - Does content address both external power structures and internalised oppression/dominance?
        - Whose knowledge is privileged and whose is marginalised?
      
      pedagogy:
        - Does content acknowledge that teaching is never neutral and examine pedagogical assumptions?
        - Are diverse perspectives genuinely integrated with attention to whose experience is centred?
    
    evaluationScenarios:
      scenario1:
        context: Module on "developing others"
        integrationTest: >
          Does it examine how feedback is experienced differently based on power relationships
          (white leader/Black staff, non-disabled manager/disabled team, male doctor/female
          nurse)? Does it name that "developmental conversations" can reproduce structural
          inequalities?
        systemsTest: >
          Does it connect individual feedback practice to organisational patterns of who
          progresses and who gets stuck?
        tokenismFailure: >
          Diversity appears as separate box with examples of "diverse" people, but power
          dynamics in feedback itself remain unexamined.
      
      scenario2:
        context: Module on "strategic thinking"
        privilegeTest: >
          Does it question whose knowledge counts as strategic? Does it examine how class
          background, education, race, gender shape access to strategic language and whose
          ideas get heard as strategic versus operational?
        criticalTest: >
          Does it acknowledge that "strategic" often means reproducing elite interests and
          examine whose interests are served by organisational strategy?
        neutralityFailure: >
          Strategic thinking presented as neutral technical competency without examination
          of power.
    
    redFlags:
      - Diversity content in separate optional section
      - Language treating white, male, non-disabled, middle-class as neutral default
      - Focus on "managing diversity" or "leveraging difference" (business case not ethical imperative)
      - Emphasis on individual resilience rather than systemic change
      - Absence of examination of power in learning relationship itself
      - Examples that unintentionally reproduce stereotypes or centre dominant group experience
      - Inclusion content that doesn't require participants to examine their own complicity

    title: Genuine Dialogue and Praxis Over Transmission
    theoreticalFoundation:
      - Critical pedagogy (Freire - dialogue vs banking education)
      - Dialogical learning
      - Praxis (reflection-action cycles)
    
    statement: >
      Design must create space for genuine dialogue (mutual learning) rather than disguised
      monologue (expert transmits knowledge). Reflection-action cycles (praxis) must be
      central, with participants invited to act on learning in ways that transform their
      organisations, not only change individual practice.
    
    testingQuestions:
      dialogueVsMonologue:
        - Does design create space for genuine dialogue or disguised monologue?
        - Is facilitator positioned as co-learner, or is expertise used to close down inquiry?
      
      praxis:
        - Are reflection-action cycles central, or is reflection separate from action?
        - Are participants invited to act on learning in transformative ways?
        - Does it acknowledge that action without reflection is activism, reflection without action is verbalism?
      
      criticalEngagement:
        - Can participants question and reject the content itself?
        - Is critical engagement with the module encouraged or discouraged?
    
    evaluationScenarios:
      scenario1:
        context: Module invites participants to experiment with new practice
        praxisTest: >
          Does it provide framework for reflecting on that action, adjusting based on
          learning, and taking further action? Does it connect individual experimentation
          to collective action for change?
        informationTransferFailure: >
          Action prescription without support for reflecting on outcomes.
      
      scenario2:
        context: Module presents theoretical framework
        dialogueTest: >
          Does it invite participants to test that theory against their experience and
          potentially reject or revise it?
        bankingFailure: >
          Theory presented as settled truth to apply rather than provocation to examine.
    
    redFlags:
      - Content presented as expert wisdom to implement rather than provocations to examine
      - Reflection divorced from action (journal prompts with no connection to practice change)
      - Action prescriptions without support for reflecting on outcomes
      - No mechanism for participants to question module premises
      - Individual focus without directing toward collective action
      - Designer voice as authoritative rather than invitational

    title: Psychodynamic Depth Addressing Unconscious Processes
    theoreticalFoundation:
      - Group dynamics and psychodynamic traditions
      - Systems psychodynamics
      - Attention to anxiety, defence, transference
    
    statement: >
      Modules must address unconscious processes, not just conscious rational dimensions.
      This includes examining role vs personal authority, providing containment for anxiety,
      challenging social defences, anticipating transference dynamics, and surfacing the
      political unconscious.
    
    testingQuestions:
      roleAndAuthority:
        - Does content help participants distinguish personal authority from role authority?
        - Does it address how authority is projected onto roles differently based on social identity?
      
      anxietyAndContainment:
        - What anxiety does this competency and its development generate?
        - Does module provide containment without premature reassurance or false control?
        - Can it hold anxiety that genuine change requires mourning?
      
      socialDefences:
        - Does content challenge organisational defences or unconsciously reproduce them?
        - Does "resilience" training defend against acknowledging organisational harm?
      
      transferenceProjection:
        - How might participants experience the module as authority figure?
        - What projections might arise (expert with answers, incompetent authority, demanding parent)?
        - Does design anticipate and work with these?
      
      politicalUnconscious:
        - What remains unspoken? Whose perspectives are systematically excluded?
        - What fantasies sustain current practice (meritocracy, neutral professionalism)?
    
    evaluationScenarios:
      scenario1:
        context: Module on "managing conflict"
        defenceTest: >
          Does it examine what anxiety conflict generates, what defensive patterns emerge
          (avoidance, aggression, triangulation), and how to work with rather than simply
          eliminate these defences?
        systemTest: >
          Does it connect individual conflict management to group dynamics and organisational
          patterns of how difference and disagreement are handled?
        technicalFailure: >
          Techniques for eliminating conflict without examining underlying anxiety.
      
      scenario2:
        context: Module on "change management"
        mourningTest: >
          Does it acknowledge that change requires mourning what's being lost? Does it
          provide space for working with resistance as meaningful?
        socialDefenceTest: >
          Does it examine how organisations defend against acknowledging the anxiety change
          generates?
        rationalistFailure: >
          Change presented as rational process without attention to emotional dimensions.
    
    redFlags:
      - Content addressing only conscious, rational dimensions
      - Techniques for eliminating anxiety rather than working with it
      - Individual skills focus without attention to group and system dynamics
      - Absence of acknowledgment that learning itself generates anxiety
      - Pathologising resistance rather than understanding it as meaningful
      - Presentational style that defends against engaging with difficulty

      - Systems theory
      - Integrative leadership model
      - Psychodynamic understanding of how domains constitute each other
      - Design Principle 4
    
    statement: >
      Modules must address competencies as operating across I (internal/personal), We
      (relational/interpersonal), and It (task/operational) domains with psychodynamic
      depth in each. These domains must be shown as constituting each other rather than
      as separate competencies.
    
    testingQuestions:
      I_internal_depth:
        - Does it address unconscious motivations, not just conscious self-awareness?
        - Does it invite examination of what defences protect from anxiety?
        - Does it connect internal experience to social identity?
      
      We_relational_depth:
        - Does it examine group dynamics and how anxiety moves through systems, not just interpersonal skills?
        - Does it address power in relationships (who can say what to whom)?
        - Does it connect dyadic relationships to team and organisational patterns?
      
      It_task_depth:
        - Does it connect task completion to emotional work required to sustain it?
        - Does it examine how power structures shape access to resources?
        - Does it link operational effectiveness to role authority and system dynamics?
      
      integration:
        - Are domains shown as constituting each other rather than separate competencies?
        - Can participants see how personal anxiety connects to group dynamics which shapes task performance?
    
    evaluationScenarios:
      scenario1:
        context: Module on giving feedback
        I_test: >
          Notice your internal response (anxiety, defensiveness, rescue fantasies) when
          preparing to give difficult feedback to differently positioned colleague.
        We_test: >
          Examine how this activates group dynamics about safety, authority, whose feelings
          matter.
        It_test: >
          Explore how these dynamics shape whether feedback actually improves performance.
        integrationTest: >
          See how your internal state shapes team culture which determines task effectiveness.
        fragmentationFailure: >
          Three separate sections on self-awareness, interpersonal skills, and performance
          management with no integration.
    
    redFlags:
      - I-We-It mentioned but treated as separate competencies
      - Internal domain addressing only conscious reflection
      - Relational domain as skills (active listening, communication) without power analysis
      - Task domain divorced from emotional and political dimensions
      - Domains presented sequentially rather than as integrated system

    testingQuestions:
      multipleEntryPoints:
        - Can participants enter at concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualisation, or active experimentation?
        - Is guidance provided for how to enter at their relevant point and continue the cycle?
      
      sustainedPractice:
        - Does design acknowledge that one pass through cycle is insufficient?
        - Is direction provided for sustained practice over time?
      
      equalValidity:
        - Are all four modes given equal validity, or is one (usually abstraction) privileged?
        - Does content work for participants at different developmental stages?

      - Reflection prompts requiring specific prior experience participants may not have
      - Action suggestions without support for reflection afterward

    title: Evidence Gathering Honouring Developmental Complexity
    theoreticalFoundation:
      - Competency assessment theory
      - Developmental journey perspective
      - Accountability to those affected
      - Design Principle 11
    
    statement: >
      Guidance must focus on evidence of changed practice over sustained time (months),
      require feedback from differently positioned others (especially those with less
      power), and acknowledge that evidence includes documentation of mistakes and ongoing
      development, not just successful outcomes.
    
    testingQuestions:
      sustainedTimeframe:
        - Does guidance focus on evidence over sustained time (months), not module completion?
        - Is there acknowledgment that evidence includes learning from failure?
      
      feedbackFromMargin:
        - Does evidence require feedback from differently positioned others?
        - Does it examine whose perspectives count as valid evidence?
        - Does it prioritise feedback from those with less power?
      
      developmentalJourney:
        - Does it frame evidence as documenting learning journey not proving achievement?
        - Does it resist pressure to provide tidy completion indicators?
      
      assessmentConnection:
        - Does it connect to formal assessment frameworks appropriately?
        - Does it acknowledge module engagement isn't competency demonstration?

          Does guidance suggest seeking feedback from Black and minoritised staff about
          changes in their practice over 3-6 months? Does it prepare them for hearing
          difficult feedback?

          Evidence criteria requiring only successful strategic outcomes.
    
    redFlags:
      - Completion quiz or knowledge test
      - Self-assessment of confidence as primary evidence
      - Short timeframe (days or weeks) for evidence gathering
      - Evidence criteria requiring only self-report or manager validation
      - Absence of requirement for feedback from those with less power
      - Focus on successful outcomes rather than quality of inquiry

    title: Accessibility and Universal Design
    theoreticalFoundation:
      - Universal design principles
      - Neurodiversity paradigm
      - Recognition that barriers are structural not individual
    
    statement: >
      Content must be accessible to neurodivergent learners and those with varied
      processing speeds. Multiple entry points and learning modalities must be provided.
      Language should avoid unnecessary jargon while maintaining conceptual rigour. Design
      must acknowledge that barriers to learning are structural, not individual deficit.
    
    testingQuestions:
      neurodivergence:
        - Is content accessible to neurodivergent learners (dyslexia, ADHD, autism)?
        - Are multiple entry points and learning modalities provided?
      
      languageAndStructure:
        - Does language avoid unnecessary jargon while maintaining rigour?
        - Is there structure and visual breaks for processing?
      
      timeAndPace:
        - Are time estimates realistic for varied processing speeds?
        - Is there flexibility in pacing and engagement?
      
      structuralAcknowledgment:
        - Does design acknowledge barriers are structural, not individual deficit?
        - Are access barriers named as design problems?
    
    redFlags:
      - Dense text without structure or visual breaks
      - Assumption of single learning pathway
      - Inaccessible academic language without glossaries or scaffolding
      - Time pressure that disadvantages disabled participants
      - Failure to name access barriers as design problems
      - Assumption of neurotypical processing

  applicationGuidance:
    howToUseCriteria: >
      These criteria should be applied systematically to module design and content. Each
      criterion includes theoretical foundation, testing questions, evaluation scenarios,
      and red flags. Use scenarios to test specific module content against the integrated
      framework. Red flags indicate serious failures requiring redesign.
    
    integrationImperative: >
      These criteria constitute an integrated whole. A module that excels in one criterion
      but fails others does not meet the design standard. Genuine transformational learning
      requires all criteria operating simultaneously: psychodynamic depth with humanistic
      trust, critical power analysis with compassionate understanding, scholarly rigour
      with accessible communication, challenge with support.
    
    priorityAreas: >
      If forced to prioritise due to constraints, focus on: (1) Criterion 3 (power and
      difference as integrated golden thread), (2) Criterion 1 (transformational inquiry
      creating genuine Q), (3) Criterion 5 (psychodynamic depth), (4) Criterion 9
      (acknowledgment of limitations). However, recognise that prioritisation itself may
      reproduce fragmentation that the integrated framework seeks to challenge.
